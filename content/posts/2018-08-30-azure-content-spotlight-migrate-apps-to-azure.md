Welcome to another Azure Content Spotlight! These articles are used to highlight items in Azure that could be more visible to the Azure community.
This weeks content spotlight is about App migration to Azure. The Cloud is changing the way applications are architected. Instead of monoliths, applications are decomposed into smaller services. These services communicate with each other through APIs or using asynchronous messaging. They can scale horizontally, so new instances can be added and removed easily. Deployments must be automated and monitoring is critical for gaining insights into the applications. And this all can be realized without the need to bother about the underlying infrastructure.
This changing way of designing and architecting applications, introduces new architectural patterns and best practices for building apps on the Azure cloud platform. Below is a set of resources which can help software architects and developers gaining insights about the different services and resources Azure has to offer to compose your applications. It also provides different patterns and best practices on how to design your applications.
