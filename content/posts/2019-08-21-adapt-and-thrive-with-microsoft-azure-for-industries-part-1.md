# Adapt and thrive with Microsoft Azure for Industries -- part 1

The way we work and live has changed. As a result of the recent global health crisis, many organizations are accelerating their digital transformation efforts to meet the challenges that they were exposed to. Employees around the world shifted to remote work, stores needed to shift to a buy online, pick up in-store model. In manufacturing, remote capabilities became key. Digital transformation has now become a requirement for business continuity, and digital technology has universally become key to business resilience and transformation.

This enormous pressure on digital transformation, since the pandemic struck, has affected all industries. A recent study from the Economist and Microsoft shows that organizations that already started their digital transformation before the pandemic, were able to adjust more quickly to meet the new customer's needs. The digital infrastructure that these industries already put in place, allowed them to not only remain competitive in the market, but also respond to societal disruption in a nimbler way. To meet the challenges of a rapidly changing economy, across all different industries, it is no longer sufficient to just adopt technology. They need to build their own technology to compete and grow. And this makes every company a technology company.

> We've seen two years' worth of digital transformation in two months. From remote teamwork and learning, to sales and customer service, to critical cloud infrastructure and security---we are working alongside customers every day to help them adapt and stay open for business in a world of remote everything."

Over the past year, Microsoft has been working closely with leaders in every industry to help them navigate the crisis. They equipped them with the right technology and tools to accelerate the digital transformation. Industry specific solutions are the key to ensure business resiliency and accelerating growth.

In this first part of a series blogs about industry solutions build on the Microsoft Azure platform, I'm going to focus on retail and healthcare solutions. We are going to focus on some use cases and the solutions and tools that Microsoft has to offer to build the different practices.

## Azure for retail

Gone are the days when retailers choose when, where, and what to sell. In this changing world, retailers are being challenged to figure out how best engage with customers within new constraints. One examples of this is adapting business processes to provide BOPIS (buy-online-and-pickup-in-store- services). Also, many retailers are driving a more sustainable model proliferation of data, are including the ability to deliver remote sales and services and are addressing the need to better equip store associates with technology.

With Azure for retail, organizations are capable of building personalized experiences, optimize their supply chains, and reimagine multichannel retail using Microsoft Azure. This includes predictive AI, machine learning, IoT, hybrid cloud, computer vision and analytics.

In the next section, we are going to look at what Microsoft Azure has to offer for healthcare organizations.

## Azure for healthcare

The healthcare industry is highly regulated. In this field, digital change is driven by the need to lower the risk of delivering patient care, while doing so at scale. The rapidly changing world is pressuring healthcare organizations to evolve how they deliver patient care as well. One example of this, is that healthcare organizations are increasingly using technology platform to shift to more telehealth services. And this example is very spot on as well in the current pandemic. By meeting patients virtually, healthcare professionals can threat (more) patients while minimizing the risk of exposure to themselves and other patients.

With Azure for healthcare, healthcare organizations can deliver better health insights and outcomes as they enhance patient engagement, empower health team collaboration, and improve clinical informatics and operational insights. All backed by a secure and trusted cloud. This includes hybrid cloud, mixed reality, AI, and IoT---to drive better health outcomes, improve security, scale faster, and enhance data interoperability.
