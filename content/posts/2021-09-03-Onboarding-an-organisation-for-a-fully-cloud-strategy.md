Technology is not only improving people's lives but is also making work
easier in many sectors. On top of that, we have all witnessed how the
pandemic has accelerated digital transformation. Launching
technology-driven initiatives to enable remote work and distance
learning, online shopping and more. For most organizations, this shift
was not possible without cloud technology.

Cloud is here to stay, and to stay ahead of competition and on top of
customer demands, more organizations need to shift to cloud computing.
But the only way to truly succeed with cloud, is by embracing it fully
across your entire organization. And this is more then just technology.
This also means that people and processes need to align to the strategy
as well.

In the next sections, we are going to look at some important aspects
that make up a successful cloud strategy.

## Preparing and training IT staff for the cloud

The first important step is to prepare ant train your IT staff. They
need to function as change agents for supporting and emerging cloud
technologies. The staff needs to have a clear understanding of both
their roles and any changes to their current position, and the business
case behind it, and they need time and resources to explore the new
cloud technologies. This team will need to lead the adoption of cloud
services and help the organization understand and embrace all necessary
changes.

Establish a Cloud Center of Excellence

Every business nowadays needs to drive digital transformation to stay
ahead of competition. This requires constantly evolving software to keep
up with competitors. Therefore, Agile development and DevOps practices
need to be in place. DevOps needs immediate availability of
infrastructure in place for deployment. And therefore, PaaS and
containers are well suited. This makes it very important to the cloud
strategy that continuous delivery is well implemented. And one way to
establish this is by implementing a Cloud Center of Excellence, which is
a control centre which the IT department can implement, supervise and
manage its cloud projects operationally. It is responsible for
implementing and managing security, compliance, performance, and cost
control in a (fully) automatic way.

## Cloud enabled applications

To fully opt-in for cloud, prioritize cloud migrations for applications
that are heavily used in your organization. This will not result in
cost-reduction in the beginning, however in the long end it will be cost
effective. It enables flexibility and scalability for apps with variable
usage. It also enables frequent deployments for these applications.
Customer feedback and changes can be incorporated at a rapid pace, which
will lead to higher agility and customer satisfaction. For all new
applications, a cloud first strategy should be the approach.

## Establish a cloud culture

This last topic is in my opinion the most important one in being
successful in cloud. And unfortunately, this is overlooked at many
organizations. Not only the IT staff needs to be trained and shifted to
a cloud centric approach. When you do a cloud transformation, is most
cases it is technology that is the biggest challenge. It is the people
and the culture. And this goes beyond your IT staff and the
professionals that run the Cloud Center of Excellence. The whole
leadership must be in and support and drive these changes in the
organization. You need some champions that advocate the new way of
working, but also recruit new passionate and skilled people.
Continuously measuring progress and outcomes must be a top priority. And
don't be afraid to fail and change the approach if needed. Changing the
way people think and work, is the most challenging part of cloud
adoption.
