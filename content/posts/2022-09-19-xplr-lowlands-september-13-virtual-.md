The volume is increasing from news around the Metaverse as well as Mixed Reality across Virtual and Augmented Reality. It can be a bit confusing. Also, what is Microsoft doing in all of these spaces? Join us for a fast-paced tour of all the realities, what Microsoft is doing in this space, understanding why this is a space for us to invest in and a look into the future.
