# Hello IPFS

This is the start of a decentralized archive for my books and articles. 

By using **IPFS** and **sjoukje.eth**, this content is no longer tied to a single hosting provider. It’s a pragmatic step towards a sovereign digital identity, ensuring my professional archive remains accessible on the decentralized web.
