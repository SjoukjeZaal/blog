Many companies fail to understand and implement Azure governance. This can result in many unwanted results, like accidentally deleting resources in your Azure environment, non-compliance with external regulations, deploying costly resources, or deploying resources in the wrong Azure regions. The solution to this is Azure governance, the ongoing process of managing, monitoring, and auditing the use of Azure resources to meet the goals and requirements of your organization.
In this session we are going to look at Azure Blueprints, Azure Policy, Management Groups and the Resource Graph to effectively manage your Azure environment.
