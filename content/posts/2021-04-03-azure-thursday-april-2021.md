April 1st was Azure Thursday again! This time, we had three amazing speakers and sessions:



Jonah Andersson | Things to Consider Before Migrating Old .NET Applications to Cloud
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Jonah Andersson shares her past experience and important lessons learned about migrating and developing old .NET applications to the Azure cloud. Find out how that project turned into a fiasco not because of Azure but of other factors. Never make the same mistakes.

Dawuda Iddrisu | Best practices for deploying MERN stack applications on Azure
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



As an engineer, it never ends with development. Deployment is always part of your package. Microsoft Azure has proven to be reliable to deploy just about any application. In this session, Kati Frantz and Dawood Iddris will show you all about deploying your MERN Stack Application and some best practices to follow. A couple of questions that will be answered include should I use PAAS or IAAS, how do I handle the CORS issue, how do I provision a database, do I need a replica of the database, how about latency, how often should I back up my database and so much more. Join us to learn it all along with us in a demo session.

Robin Smorenburg | The Azure Bakery
-----------------------------------



Welcome to 'The Azure Bakery.' In this talk, we'll bake a delicious layered Azure cake. The idea behind this talk is to approach Azure in an easy to understand and fun way. The goal is to engineer and deploy solutions in the best way possible. At the same time, we're trying to keep it simple. We'll bake the foundational layers of every future Azure solution. What is needed when building these solutions?
