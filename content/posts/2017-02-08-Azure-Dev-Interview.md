**Who are you, and what do you do?**

My name is Sjoukje Zaal and I live in The Netherlands. I work as a
Principal Architect & Lead Productivity for Ordina, an IT company in the
Benelux (Belgium, The Netherlands, and Luxemburg). Sixteen years ago, I
started my career as a web designer. After that I worked as a software
developer for several years and for the last 6 years I work as an
Architect.

In my daily job, I work with customers on Azure, Office 365 and
Microsoft integration solutions. Besides that, I spend a lot of time on
participating in the Microsoft community.

**How do you contribute to the community?**

I am a co-founder for SP&C NL, a Dutch community website with articles
about Azure, Office 365 and SharePoint. I 'm also very active in the
MSDN community, moderating the Azure, BizTalk, SharePoint and Office 365
developer forums, answering questions and writing Wiki articles and blog
articles for these topics. Besides that, I am also involved in the Azure
Advisors Yammer group.

**How long have you been answering questions on MSDN Forums? What have
you learned from that experience?**

I started answering questions back in 2008, only for SharePoint. I took
a break for a couple of years when I was focusing on other technologies,
like Azure and BizTalk. The last couple of years I am more active again.
Answering questions gives me the ability to become much better at these
technologies, learning new things and share my learnings and experience
with others.

**Why do you contribute to TechNet Wiki articles? What kind of articles
have you written, and why?**

The TechNet Wiki articles have helped me a lot in my career with
troubleshooting and solving issues. As I became more experienced I
wanted to give something back to the community. When a question is asked
multiple times in the MSDN forum, I find the solution, write it down and
create a Wiki article about it. This way it can help a lot of people
solving issues and gaining new insights. So far, my articles are mainly
about Office 365, Azure Logic Apps and BizTalk.

**Tell me about your involvement with Azure Advisors. How do you give
feedback and impact Azure tools and services?**

My involvement mainly focusses on reading and answering questions that
are asked by Azure customers inside the group. Microsoft employees are
also part of this group, so you can join Skype meetings as well and stay
updated on news, issues and updates.

**Who has impressed you in the Azure development community, and why?**

I don't have a particular person but I'm impressed by anyone who takes
the time and effort to make contributions to the community. It helped me
throughout my career and will help a lot of others in the future.

**Do you have any tips for new community members?**

You learn as you go along...
