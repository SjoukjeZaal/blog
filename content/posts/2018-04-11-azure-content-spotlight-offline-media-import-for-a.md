Welcome to another Azure Content Spotlight! These articles are used to highlight items in Azure that could be more visible to the Azure community.
More and more organizations are embracing the Microsoft Cloud these days and want to upload their offline data stores into Azure to benefit of all the features and capabilities Azure has to offer. Microsoft (together with partners) introduces an offline service for migrating these on-premises data easily. Organizations will only have to choose the Azure storage tier and the partners will take care of the rest. This service is suitable for all types of media and data, like SAN and NAS data, disks or tapes, or even video cassettes or 35mm, and partners can work with organizations all over the globe.
