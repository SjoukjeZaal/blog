Yesterday we had a very interesting Azure Thursday meetup again. We had the following speakers and sessions:



Scott Hanselman | Part II: Moving a 17 year old legacy blog platform to the cloud
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Scott's blog is super old. The tech is super old. Scott is super old. What happens when he tries to move the whole Hanselman online mess to Azure? Let's talk to him and find out.



This is part II in this saga we started last July. Scott will tell us how he succeeded and everyone knows the part II in the saga is even better than the first one.

Martijn Beenker - The enterprise data lake: monitoring at scale
---------------------------------------------------------------



When data lakes grow, they grow in size, complexity and inhabitants - creating complex dependencies across wide ranges of Azure services and different teams. Creating a true operations challenge: how do you find and respond to incidents, and who should respond?



During this session, we’ll look at how to monitor across the boundaries of Azure services and development teams that together make the ecosystem of the data lake. Aided by the Four Golden Signals and Azure Monitor capabilities we’ll create the blueprint for effective monitoring and incident handling. No matter how big the lake.
