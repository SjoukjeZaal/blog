Arjan Nieuwenhuis: Keeping track on all your apps
-------------------------------------------------



Managing your apps during the whole software development lifecycle and beyond is hard as apps come in all shapes and sizes and can target multiple platforms. Keeping track on your apps from early stage development to production can be a handful, especially as target platforms are whole ecosystems.



To help you bringing these ecosystems together Visual Studio App Center provides a integrated service on Azure. Assisting in all the stages of the software development lifecycle, bringing it all together in one integrated place.



Join me in exploring the current state of Visual Studio App Center and sneak peek on what is coming soon.

Marilag Dimatulac: Applying Message Brokering & Event-Driven Architecture on Azure
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The most fun part with any cloud architecture styles is seeing it in action. In this session, I'll demonstrate how we can design and implement event-driven applications on the cloud. We'll look into several building blocks, from using event modeling to communicate our specification, to implementing in-process messaging in .Net Core with the mediator pattern, and finally using Queues & Event Grid on Azure to wire things together and complete our story.
