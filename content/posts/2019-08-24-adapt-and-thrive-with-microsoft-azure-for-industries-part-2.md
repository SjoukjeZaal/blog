This is the second article in a series about the different solutions that Microsoft Azure has to offer for specific industries. In my first post, I covered how these industry specific solutions help organizations to accelerate their digital transformation, and why this is so important nowadays.

In this second part, we will look at the manufacturing, financials services and government industries.

## Azure for manufacturing

In the upcoming years, instead of selling unconnected products, manufacturers will start focusing more on selling products that come with connectivity services. They will also move from selling a discrete product to selling products as a service. To accommodate global crises, manufacturers will also seek ways to be more agile and responsive to changing market demands. Manufacturers are building digital feedback loops that help companies connect with their products and customers to continuously learn, grow, and improve existing services, as well as build new ones.

With Azure for manufacturing, organizations can keep pace with customer needs and market trends and drive business transformation, by modernizing to a smart factory with Azure.

Azure for manufacturing includes the following tools and services:
