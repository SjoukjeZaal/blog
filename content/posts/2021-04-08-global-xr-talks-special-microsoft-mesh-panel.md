On April 1st, we had our first Global XR Talks special! This was all about the release of Microsoft Mesh.



A panel of industry experts discussed this amazing technology and all the functionalities it has to offer. With hot new information straight from Microsoft and well known Microsoft MVPs, host Jesse McCulloch and a brilliant lineup of speakers (Simon Skaria, Dorrene Brown, René Schulte, Ivana Tilca and Joost van Schaik) are joined by our own Saskia Groenewegen and Alexander Meijers for an hour of inspiration and innovation.
