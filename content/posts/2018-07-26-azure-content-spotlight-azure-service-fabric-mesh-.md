Welcome to another Azure Content Spotlight! These articles are used to highlight items in Azure that could be more visible to the Azure community.
This week's content spotlight is about Azure Service Fabric Mesh, which is now in preview. Azure Service Fabric Mesh offers a fully managed service for developers to deploy microservices applications without managing the infrastructure, like storage, networking or virtual machines. It consists of clusters of thousands of machines and all of the cluster operations are hidden from the developer.
You can watch the Azure Friday video about Service Fabric Mesh below:
