On April 21st we had an amazing Global XR Talks again! We had the following session:



XR Session - Building WebXR Apps for the HoloLens
-------------------------------------------------



Microsoft recently released the Chromium version of Microsoft Edge for HoloLens. This means that a lot of Web APIs that weren't previously available now can be used, like the WebXR Device API for example. By building a simple game, I'll show you how you can use WebXR and other APIs on the HoloLens.



Speaker: Timmy Kokke - Lead Developer ⍟ Software Architect ⍟ Mobile, Web and VR/AR Developer ⍟ Microsoft MVP at Velicus



And of course, after te session we did some virtual socializing in our Global XR Community zone in AltSpaceVR!
