We are reaching the end of the Global AI Bootcamp 2022, and we’d like to introduce you to organizers from all over the world to learn more about their events: who are they and what content (did) they provide? In 6 different episodes (and timezones) we’ll focus on specific regions, and like the bootcamp, we’ll go around the world to connect to everyone.



The Global AI Bootcamp is a series of free one-day events organized across the world by local communities that are passionate about artificial intelligence on Microsoft Azure. Check out the official ***[Global AI Bootcamp](\"https://globalai.community/bootcamp-2022/\")*** website, for more information and an overview of all the events.
