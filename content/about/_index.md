20 years of AI, Cloud, Data, and Software Development. Building a sovereign archive on the decentralized web.


As **Chief Technology Officer** I focus on AI, data, cloud, security, and the next wave of innovation, helping organizations turn technology into real, measurable impact. I started my career writing code, grew into solution architecture, and now shape strategy as CTO. This space is where I share those lessons — from the command line to the boardroom, and everything in between.

Outside of work, I keep my curiosity (and sanity) alive through the things that recharge me:

* 🎮 **Gaming** — sprawling RPGs, fast-paced shooters, and the occasional retro arcade.
* 🎸 **Heavy metal** — my soundtrack for boss fights and workouts alike.
* 🏋️ **Sports & fitness** — squash, kettlebells, and training sessions that clear my mind.
* 🍳 **Cooking** — experimenting in the kitchen or slow-smoking on the Kamado.
* ✈️ **Travel** — collecting spices, stories, and fresh perspectives.
* 📚 **Books** — from edge-of-your-seat thrillers to technical deep-dives on AI and leadership.
* 🧪 **Tinkering** — hands-on with Web3 and AI side projects.

This blog connects the dots between technology, leadership, and life — the balance between building systems and leading people.

Thanks for visiting — I’d love for you to follow along.
