Cloud skills are becoming more popular every day! A lot of organizations are embracing the cloud for their applications, infrastructure, Machine Learning and IoT solutions. And this will grow significally in the next years!



This also means that (Microsoft) IT professionals need to update their skills as well. In this article I will give an overview how you can get started updating your skills and be ready for all the Azure work that is coming in the near future!



Create a free Azure account
---------------------------



The first step, is to create a free Azure account. With this account you can test all the different services and deploy your code to Azure during the different trainings. You get 12 months of free access to all the different Azure services for a limited amount per month.



You can create a free Azure account here: [Create your Azure free account today | Microsoft Azure](\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/\"). There is also a module on Microsoft Learn that gives you more information about creating a free Azure account, and how billing and support works in Azure. This module is called: [Create an Azure account](\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-an-azure-account/\").
