The Video Indexer is part of the AI offering of Microsoft and offers an application and platform built upon media AI technologies. It offers features to extract insights from video and audio files, which uses the [Speech to Text API](\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/\")of Cognitive Services. It creates a transcript based on the speech appearing in the video or audio file, which can be translated into an impressive amount of languages.
