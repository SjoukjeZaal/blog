Welcome to another Azure Content Spotlight! These articles are used to highlight items in Azure that could be more visible to the Azure community.
IoT is hot! Microsoft recently announced that they are going to invest $5 billion in the Internet of Things over the next four years. Why? Because their goal is to give every customer the ability to transform their businesses, and the world at large, with connected solutions. And why now? Because they now see the kind of increased adoption and exponential growth that analysts have been forecasting for the past years. You can refer to the full article here:[https://blogs.microsoft.com/iot/2018/04/04/microsoft-will-invest-5-billion-in-iot-heres-why/](\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/iot/2018/04/04/microsoft-will-invest-5-billion-in-iot-heres-why/\")
But now back to the development part of it. IoT offers tremendous opportunities for developers and the recently published [IoT Interactive Development Guide](\"https://content.microsoft.com/iot/developerguide\")offers common application patterns and tutorials that will get you up and running fast. If you are planning on doing some IoT development or if you are just curious, you should really take a look! It offers a lot of valuable information for beginning and more experienced IoT developers.
