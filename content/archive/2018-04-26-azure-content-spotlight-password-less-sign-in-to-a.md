Welcome to another Azure Content Spotlight! These articles are used to highlight items in Azure that could be more visible to the Azure community.
Microsoft has made a huge step in their drive to eliminate passwords for good!
In the next Windows updates, they're adding a limited preview of FIDO2 security key support. This will improve security significantly and cut the risk of phishing attacks.This new capability will give employees the ability to sign in to an Azure Active Directory-joined Windows 10 PC without a username or password. All that is needed is to insert a [FIDO2](\"https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/\")compliant security key into their USB port and they will automatically be signed in to the device and get Single-sign on access to all Azure AD protected cloud resources.
Check out the following video to see how this works:
