Today we publish our first episode of **Walking with the RD's**!



Together with my fellow Microsoft Regional Directors from the Netherlands, **Marcel de Vries**: CTO of Xpirit, **Maarten Goet**: Director at Wortell, **Maarten Eekels**: Chief, Digital Officer and Managing Partner at Portiva, and **Andre Carlucci**, Global Director of Application Engineering at Kinley, we will do a monthly walk where we will discuss various business related topics.

**“Working from home’ while still performing. How do we deal with this and what has worked very well for ourselves and the teams we work with.**
