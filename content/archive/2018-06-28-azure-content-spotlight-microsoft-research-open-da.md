Welcome to another Azure Content Spotlight! These articles are used to highlight items in Azure that could be more visible to the Azure community.

This week's content spotlight is about [Microsoft Research Open Data](\"https://msropendata.com/\"), a new data repository in the cloud dedicated to facilitating collaboration across the global research community. It offers datasets representing many years of data research which were used in published research studies. Microsoft Research Open Data is an outcome of the Microsoft Research Outreach Data science program and was made possible by a collaboration between many teams at Microsoft, Microsoft researchers, academic advisors, and various industry partners.
The goal of this platform is to share datasets and other research related tools with Microsoft researchers and collaborators. Datasets can easily be accessed and the platform provides datasets of state-of-the-art research in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and domain specific sciences. This datasets can be downloaded or copied directly to a cloud-based Data Science Virtual Machine from the portal.
