Today I found a very handy tool to check your computer or server security settings: The Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer. This tool determines if Windows administrative vulnerabilities are present, If weak passwords are being used and it checks if there are any vulnerabilities in IIS and SQL Server.

After installing the tool you can scan your server or computer. After completion it provides you with a detailed report and instructions on how to make your environment more secure.

Fore more information on how to use this tool check the following site: [http://blogs.technet.com/b/security/archive/2012/10/22/microsoft-free-security-tools-microsoft-baseline-security-analyzer.aspx?Redirected=true](http://blogs.technet.com/b/security/archive/2012/10/22/microsoft-free-security-tools-microsoft-baseline-security-analyzer.aspx?Redirected=true)
