Welcome to another Azure Content Spotlight! These articles are used to highlight items in Azure that could be more visible to the Azure community.
This weeks content spotlight is about Cognitive Service Containers, which is released in preview last week. There was a high demand for the flexibility to deploy AI applications in a variety of environments. By deploying Cognitive Services in containers, data can be analyzed close to where the actual data resides. And these containers can be deployed on on-premises environments as well, so customer data (e.g., the image or text that is being analyzed) is not sent to Microsoft.
For information and how to get started with Cognitive Service Containers, you can refer to the below links:
