Azure for manufacturing
In the upcoming years, instead of selling unconnected products, manufacturers will start focusing more on selling products that come with connectivity services. They will also move from selling a discrete product to selling products as a service. To accommodate global crises, manufacturers will also seek ways to be more agile and responsive to changing market demands.
