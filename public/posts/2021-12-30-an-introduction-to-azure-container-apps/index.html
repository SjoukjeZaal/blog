Azure Container Apps is released during Ignite, in September 2021, and currently still in preview. The IT industry is embracing containerization heavily the last couple of years, but struggles managing the infrastructure. Kubernetes, the facto standard at many organizations, is challenging to learn and to manage for many IT professionals. Azure Container Apps offers a solution for this: this service is specifically aimed to deploy containerized applications without the need to manage complex infrastructure. It manages the details of Kubernetes and container orchestrations for you.\nIn this article I will tell you more about the features Azure Container Apps provide, and how this service differs from the other container services that Microsoft offers in Azure.\nAzure Container Apps With Azure Container Apps you can run your containerized applications and your microservices on a serverless platform. Applications can be written in different programming languages or frameworks, and it offers full support for Distributed Application Runtime (DAPR) and Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA) to scale your applications or microservices dynamically based on the HTTP traffic or events that occur.\nAzure Container Apps is suitable for running microservices, handling event-driven processing, hosting background applications, and deploying API endpoints. Your applications can scale dynamically based on CPU or memory load, event-driven processing, HTTP traffic, or KEDA-supported scalers.\nThis service offers the following features and capabilities:\nRun multiple revisions of containers: Azure Containers Apps works application lifecycle resolves around revisions. When you deploy your first application in Azure Container Apps, the first revision of your application is automatically created. As containers get change or get updated, more revisions get created.\nSupport for running applications from multiple container registries: Azure Container Apps supports multiple container registries to store your images. It offers support for both public and private registries, such as Azure Container Registry, Docker. Basically, any Linux-based container image is supported from any public or private registry.\nAutoscaling: Applications can be scaled automatically by any KEDA-supported scale trigger. Most applications can scale to zero, except applications that are configured to scale on CPU or memory load.\nBuilding microservices with DAPR: Building applications using microservices based architecture, introduces a lot of complexity. You need to account for failures, retries, and timeouts, spread across the network and the distributed services. DAPR includes features to make life a lot easier, it includes features like observability, retries, pub/sub, and service-to-service invocation with mutual TLS, and much more.\nSupport for ARM templates, PowerShell, and Azure CLI: You can use ARM templates, PowerShell, and the Azure CLI to deploy your containers apps services in Azure and applications that run on it. Besides ARM and the Azure CLI, you can also use Bicep to deploy Azure Container Apps and the applications.\nEnables HTTP Ingress: Applications and microservices that run on Azure Container Apps can be exposed to the public web by enabling ingress. By using ingress, you don’t need to create an Azure Load Balancer, public IP address, or any other Azure resource to enable incoming HTTPS request. In my opinion, this is most suitable for smaller organizations. For most enterprises a load balancer or multiple load balancers are already part of the architecture (and security requirements) and the preferred way for enabling incoming traffic.\nInternal ingress and service discovery: Ingress can also be enabled for internal communication between the different microservices, or applications deployed inside the same Container Apps environment. When ingress is enabled, each container app will be exposed through a domain name.\nSplit traffic: Azure Container Apps offer support for traffic direction strategies, such as A/B testing and Bluegreen deployments. For instance, you can configure traffic splitting rules that split traffic based on percentages. You can assign percentage values to balance traffic among different revisions.\nViewing application logs: Azure Container Apps has support for Azure Log Analytics. Data logged via a container app are stored inside a custom table in the Log Analytics workspace. These logs can then be viewed through the Azure portal or with the Azure CLI.\nComparing Container Apps with other Azure container options Currently, there are a lot options you can choose from when developing container applications and host them on Azure. Microsoft has released a number of Azure container-based products that all have their own characteristics and are suitable in certain scenarios. Below, you see an overview of the different services and the scenarios and use cases for each service, compared to Azure Container Apps:\nAzure Container Apps As mentioned before, with Azure Container Apps you can deploy containerized apps without managing the complex infrastructure. It is powered by Kubernetes and open-source technologies like Dapr, KEDA, and envoy. It fully supports Kubernetes style applications and microservices with features like service discovery and traffic splitting. It also offers support for scaling based on traffic and pulling from event sources like queues, including scale to zero.\nHowever, because it is a serverless platform, it doesn’t provide direct access to the underlying Kubernetes APIs. If access to the Kubernetes APIs and control plane is required, then you should consider using Azure Kubernetes Service. If this access is not required, then Azure Container Apps provide a fully managed experience based on industry best-practices.\nAzure Container Instances Azure Container Instances offers a single pod of Hyper-V isolated containers on demand. Compared to Azure Container Apps, this can be thought of as a lower level \"building block\". ACI does not provide features such as scaling, load balancing, and certificates. For instance, to scale to three container instances, you create three distinct container instances. ACI is often used to interact with through other services, Azure Kubernetes can layer orchestration and scale on top of ACI through virtual nodes. If you don’t have scaling, load balancing, or certificate requirements for your applications, ACI can be a good solution.\nAzure App Service Azure App Service is optimized for web applications. It provides fully managed hosting for web applications including websites and web APIs. These applications can be deployed on Azure App Service using code or containers, and it integrates with other Azure services including Azure Container Apps or Azure Functions. This makes it most suitable for scenario’s where you only build web apps.\nAzure Kubernetes Service Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) offers a fully managed Kubernetes option in Azure, which includes access to the Kubernetes API and control plane. The full cluster resides in your Azure subscription, which makes you responsible for managing the cluster configurations and operations. If you are looking for a fully managed version of Kubernetes in Azure, AKS is a good solution.\nAzure Functions Azure Functions is optimized for running event-driven applications using the functions programming model. It offers similar functionality with Azure Container Apps around scaling and integration with events but is mostly optimized for ephemeral functions. They can be deployed using code and containers, where the latter makes it portable to deploy them to other container-based platforms. They are most suitable in scenarios where you want to trigger the execution of your functions on events and bind to other data sources in Azure.\nAzure Spring Cloud When you are developing Spring Boot microservice applications, Azure Spring Cloud makes it easy to deploy them to Azure without any code changes. This is a fully managed service so developers can focus only on writing the code, instead of managing the environment. Azure Spring Cloud provides lifecycle management using CI/CD integration, configuration management, monitoring and diagnostics, service discovery, blue-green deployments, and more. In scenarios where your development team is predominantly Spring, this is a good solution.\nGetting started Want to get started with Azure Container Apps and experience it yourself?

  <div class="post-content"><p>Nowadays, nearly every developer is a developer of distributed
applications or systems. Modern software development involves building
distributed applications: almost every application leverages a
distributed architecture, and most are backed by services in the public
cloud. Microservices are a successful approach for building distributed
services. And by using containers to build these microservices, you will
introduce scalability, faster deployments, and the ability to run
applications everywhere.</p>
<p>Microsoft recently released a new container service in Azure: Azure
Container Apps, which is a serverless container service for running
modern apps at scale. Azure Container Apps is released during Ignite, in
September 2021, and currently still in preview. The IT industry is
embracing containerization heavily the last couple of years, but
struggles managing the infrastructure. Kubernetes, the facto standard at
many organizations, is challenging to learn and to manage for many IT
professionals. Azure Container Apps offers a solution for this: this
service is specifically aimed to deploy containerized applications
without the need to manage complex infrastructure. It manages the
details of Kubernetes and container orchestrations for you.</p>
<p>In this article I will tell you more about the features Azure Container
Apps provide, and how this service differs from the other container
services that Microsoft offers in Azure.</p>
<h2 id="azure-container-apps">Azure Container Apps<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#azure-container-apps">#</a></h2>
<p>With Azure Container Apps you can run your containerized applications
and your microservices on a serverless platform. Applications can be
written in different programming languages or frameworks, and it offers
full support for <a href="https://dapr.io/">Distributed Application Runtime
(DAPR)</a> and <a href="https://keda.sh/">Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling
(KEDA)</a> to scale your applications or microservices
dynamically based on the HTTP traffic or events that occur.</p>
<p>Azure Container Apps is suitable for running microservices, handling
event-driven processing, hosting background applications, and deploying
API endpoints. Your applications can scale dynamically based on CPU or
memory load, event-driven processing, HTTP traffic, or <a href="https://keda.sh/docs/2.5/scalers/">KEDA-supported
scalers</a>.</p>
<p>This service offers the following features and capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Run multiple <em>revisions</em> of containers:</strong> Azure Containers Apps
works application lifecycle resolves around revisions. When you deploy
your first application in Azure Container Apps, the first revision of
your application is automatically created. As containers get change or
get updated, more revisions get created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for running applications from multiple container
registries:</strong> Azure Container Apps supports multiple container
registries to store your images. It offers support for both public and
private registries, such as Azure Container Registry, Docker.
Basically, any Linux-based container image is supported from any
public or private registry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Autoscaling:</strong> Applications can be scaled automatically by any
KEDA-supported scale trigger. Most applications can scale to zero,
except applications that are configured to scale on CPU or memory
load.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Building microservices with DAPR:</strong> Building applications using
microservices based architecture, introduces a lot of complexity. You
need to account for failures, retries, and timeouts, spread across the
network and the distributed services.
<a href="https://docs.dapr.io/concepts/overview/">DAPR</a> includes features to
make life a lot easier, it includes features like observability,
retries, pub/sub, and service-to-service invocation with mutual TLS,
and much more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for ARM templates, PowerShell, and Azure CLI:</strong> You can use
ARM templates, PowerShell, and the Azure CLI to deploy your containers
apps services in Azure and applications that run on it. Besides ARM
and the Azure CLI, you can also use Bicep to deploy Azure Container
Apps and the applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enables HTTP Ingress:</strong> Applications and microservices that run on
Azure Container Apps can be exposed to the public web by enabling
ingress. By using ingress, you don&rsquo;t need to create an Azure Load
Balancer, public IP address, or any other Azure resource to enable
incoming HTTPS request. In my opinion, this is most suitable for
smaller organizations. For most enterprises a load balancer or
multiple load balancers are already part of the architecture (and
security requirements) and the preferred way for enabling incoming
traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Internal ingress and service discovery:</strong> Ingress can also be
enabled for internal communication between the different
microservices, or applications deployed inside the same Container Apps
environment. When ingress is enabled, each container app will be
exposed through a domain name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Split traffic:</strong> Azure Container Apps offer support for traffic
direction strategies, such as A/B testing and Bluegreen deployments.
For instance, you can configure traffic splitting rules that split
traffic based on percentages. You can assign percentage values to
balance traffic among different revisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Viewing application logs:</strong> Azure Container Apps has support for
Azure Log Analytics. Data logged via a container app are stored inside
a custom table in the Log Analytics workspace. These logs can then be
viewed through the Azure portal or with the Azure CLI.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, there are a lot options you can choose from when developing
container applications and host them on Azure. Microsoft has released a
number of Azure container-based products that all have their own
characteristics and are suitable in certain scenarios. Below, you see an
overview of the different services and the scenarios and use cases for
each service, compared to Azure Container Apps:</p>
<h3 id="azure-container-apps-1">Azure Container Apps<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#azure-container-apps-1">#</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned before, with Azure Container Apps you can deploy
containerized apps without managing the complex infrastructure. It is
powered by Kubernetes and open-source technologies like Dapr, KEDA, and
<a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">envoy</a>. It fully supports Kubernetes style
applications and microservices with features like service discovery and
traffic splitting. It also offers support for scaling based on traffic
and pulling from event sources like queues, including scale to zero.</p>
<p>However, because it is a serverless platform, it doesn&rsquo;t provide direct
access to the underlying Kubernetes APIs. If access to the Kubernetes
APIs and control plane is required, then you should consider using Azure
Kubernetes Service. If this access is not required, then Azure Container
Apps provide a fully managed experience based on industry
best-practices.</p>
<h3 id="azure-container-instances">Azure Container Instances<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#azure-container-instances">#</a></h3>
<p>Azure Container Instances offers a single pod of Hyper-V isolated
containers on demand. Compared to Azure Container Apps, this can be
thought of as a lower level &quot;building block&quot;. ACI does not provide
features such as scaling, load balancing, and certificates. For
instance, to scale to three container instances, you create three
distinct container instances. ACI is often used to interact with through
other services, Azure Kubernetes can layer orchestration and scale on
top of ACI through virtual nodes. If you don&rsquo;t have scaling, load
balancing, or certificate requirements for your applications, ACI can be
a good solution.</p>
<h3 id="azure-app-service">Azure App Service<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#azure-app-service">#</a></h3>
<p>Azure App Service is optimized for web applications. It provides fully
managed hosting for web applications including websites and web APIs.
These applications can be deployed on Azure App Service using code or
containers, and it integrates with other Azure services including Azure
Container Apps or Azure Functions. This makes it most suitable for
scenario&rsquo;s where you only build web apps.</p>
<h3 id="azure-kubernetes-service">Azure Kubernetes Service<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#azure-kubernetes-service">#</a></h3>
<p>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) offers a fully managed Kubernetes option
in Azure, which includes access to the Kubernetes API and control plane.
The full cluster resides in your Azure subscription, which makes you
responsible for managing the cluster configurations and operations. If
you are looking for a fully managed version of Kubernetes in Azure, AKS
is a good solution.</p>
<h3 id="azure-functions">Azure Functions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#azure-functions">#</a></h3>
<p>Azure Functions is optimized for running event-driven applications using
the functions programming model. It offers similar functionality with
Azure Container Apps around scaling and integration with events but is
mostly optimized for ephemeral functions. They can be deployed using
code and containers, where the latter makes it portable to deploy them
to other container-based platforms. They are most suitable in scenarios
where you want to trigger the execution of your functions on events and
bind to other data sources in Azure.</p>
<h3 id="azure-spring-cloud">Azure Spring Cloud<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#azure-spring-cloud">#</a></h3>
<p>When you are developing Spring Boot microservice applications, Azure
Spring Cloud makes it easy to deploy them to Azure without any code
changes. This is a fully managed service so developers can focus only on
writing the code, instead of managing the environment. Azure Spring
Cloud provides lifecycle management using CI/CD integration,
configuration management, monitoring and diagnostics, service discovery,
blue-green deployments, and more. In scenarios where your development
team is predominantly Spring, this is a good solution.</p>
