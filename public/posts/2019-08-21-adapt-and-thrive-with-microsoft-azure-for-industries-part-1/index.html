The way we work and live has changed. As a result of the recent global health crisis, many organizations are accelerating their digital transformation efforts to meet the challenges that they were exposed to. Employees around the world shifted to remote work, stores needed to shift to a buy online, pick up in-store model. In manufacturing, remote capabilities became key.

In this changing world, retailers are being challenged to figure out how best engage with customers within new constraints. One examples of this is adapting business processes to provide BOPIS (buy-online-and-pickup-in-store- services).

In this field, digital change is driven by the need to lower the risk of delivering patient care, while doing so at scale. The rapidly changing world is pressuring healthcare organizations to evolve how they deliver patient care as well.
