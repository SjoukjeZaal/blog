  <div class="post-content"><p><strong>Why did you want to become an MVP?</strong></p>
<p>The Microsoft community helped me to become the Microsoft professional that I am right now. I wanted to give something back to the community and help others to learn and become a better professional. This is the main reason why I wanted to become an MVP: sharing knowledge with the community, learn from the community, and grow both professionally and personally.</p>
<p><strong>What do you love the most about being an MVP?</strong></p>
<p>When you become an MVP you get to meet a lot of new people that share the same passion. They are all eager to share their knowledge with the community and learn from the community. Together, you can make great things happen such as, delivering great conferences, writing books, organizing global events, and much more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still learning, meeting new people, and expanding my knowledge every day. New opportunities arise to grow both professionally and personally. And it also resulted in making lots of new friends around the globe.</p>
<p><strong>What are the top three benefits of being an MVP</strong></p>
<p>For me the top 3 benefits are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Being able to work with and learn from the top professionals in the field</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traveling and meeting new people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working closely with Microsoft</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How has being an MVP improved your standing in the technical community?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of doors opened up when I became an MVP. In my first year I was asked to write my first book. The second year I started with public speaking and I became part of organizing global events in my third year. All these activities helped me to gain a strong footprint in the Microsoft community.</p>
<p><strong>How do contribute to the community?</strong></p>
<p>I really love what I&rsquo;m doing so I&rsquo;m very active in the community! I write books and blogs, which are mostly Azure related. I&rsquo;m part of organizing lots of global and local events, such as Azure Thursday, Global Azure and Global XR Talks. I&rsquo;m running the community website Tech Daily Chronicle and I&rsquo;m involved in the Global AI Community. I also really like public speaking, so I travel around the globe to speak at conferences and user groups.</p>
