<meta name="keywords" content="">
<meta name="description" content="The role of the architect is being rewritten.
Not by new frameworks or methodologies, but by intelligent systems that can design, optimize, and learn on their own.
As AI agents, autonomous workflows, and generative tools become part of daily operations, architecture itself becomes dynamic.
It’s no longer a static blueprint. It’s a living system that continuously adapts and improves.
From Control to Coordination
For years, architecture has centered on control: standards, reviews, governance.
But in an agentic world, control alone is not enough.
