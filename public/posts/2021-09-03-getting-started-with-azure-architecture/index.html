<h2 id="cloud-adoption-framework">Cloud Adoption Framework<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cloud-adoption-framework">#</a></h2>
<p>The Cloud Adoption Framework is a collection of documentation,
best-practices, implementation guidance and tools that can accelerate
cloud adoption in organizations. It is focused on different
methodologies, such as strategy, planning, readiness, migrations,
innovation, governance, managing, and organizing which all together

<h2 id="landing-zones">Landing zones<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#landing-zones">#</a></h2>
<p>Microsoft offers a set of enterprise scale landing zones that you can
use to get started as well. A landing zone is an environment for hosting
your workloads, preprovisioned through code. Because no single solution
will fit all technical environments, there are a couple of landing zone
implementations that you can choose from to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/blob/main/docs/reference/wingtip/README.md">Enterprise-Scale
foundation</a>:
This landing zone offers a foundation for organizations to support
their application portfolios, regardless of whether the applications
are being migrated or are newly developed and deployed to Azure. It
enables organizations to start as small as needed and scale alongside
their business requirements. It is a good solution when hybrid
connectivity to on-premises datacenters is not required from the
start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/blob/main/docs/reference/treyresearch/README.md">Enterprise-scale for small
enterprises:</a>
This landing zone is similar to the foundation one above. It also
allows organizations to start small. This reference implementation is
aimed at organizations that do not have a large IT team and do not
require fine grained administration delegation models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/blob/main/docs/reference/contoso/Readme.md">Enterprise-Scale with Azure
VWAN:</a>
This landing zone offers a foundation for organizations that want to
focus on application portfolios and hybrid connectivity with
ExpressRoute or VPN. It also offers an architecture based on an Azure
Virtual WAN network topology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/blob/main/docs/reference/adventureworks/README.md">Enterprise-Scale with hub and spoke

</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="well-architected-framework">Well-Architected Framework<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#well-architected-framework">#</a></h2>
<p>Lastly, I want to cover the Azure Well Architected Framework. This can
be used to improve the quality of your workloads on Azure. The framework
consists of five pillars of architecture excellence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/cost/overview">Cost
optimization</a>:
The principles of cost optimization are a series of important
considerations that can help achieve both business objectives and cost
justification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/devops/overview">Operational

This pillar covers the operations processes that keep an application

deployments, which can easily roll back or forward when required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/scalability/overview">Performance
Efficiency</a>:
Performance efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to
meet the demands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/principles">Reliability</a>:
In the cloud, we acknowledge up front that failures will happen.
Instead of trying to prevent failures altogether, the goal is to
minimize the effects of a single failing component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/security/overview">Security</a>:
Extremely important nowadays. You should protect your applications and
