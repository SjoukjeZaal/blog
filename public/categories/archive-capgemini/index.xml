      <description>&lt;p&gt;Data and AI platforms are at the heart of digital transformation. But too often, they are built on proprietary formats and closed models that create silos, raise costs, and limit flexibility. In a world where organizations need interoperability, sovereignty, and speed, this approach is no longer sustainable. Open standards offer a better path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Lock-In to Openness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data and AI platforms used to be closed worlds. Proprietary formats, vendor-specific connectors, and black-box models accelerated adoption, but at a cost: lock-in, high switching barriers, and reduced sovereignty. Once data was stored in a proprietary format or models were trained in a closed environment, moving them became difficult and costly. Enterprises often found themselves redesigning workflows, rewriting code, or even discarding valuable assets when switching vendors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
