Is your team ready?\nLarge Language Models have already changed how we interact with data. But the rise of agentic AI — systems that reason, take action, and adapt — goes even further.\nThese agents don’t just answer questions. They perform tasks, orchestrate workflows, and make real-time decisions.\nThat changes everything for data \u0026amp; AI teams.\nIf you’re still focused on dashboards, isolated models, or batch pipelines, you’re building for the past.\nFrom models and pipelines to intelligent systems\nAgentic AI shifts the purpose of the work we’ve done for years.\nHere’s how typical tasks are evolving:\nWhat’s changing:\nFrom building data pipelines → to agents that orchestrate and generate workflows From predictive models → to agents that combine models with reasoning From dashboards → to agents that make or automate decisions From manual cataloging → to agents that explore and reason over metadata It doesn’t mean your work disappears.\nBut it needs a new goal: to enable AI systems that interact, learn, and deliver outcomes.\nWhat Needs to Change (Internally)# Agentic AI forces a new operating model.\nHere’s how to structure your team for what’s coming next:\nTeams → From data silos to product pods# Form cross-functional pods focused on capabilities, not temporary project scopes (e.g. “real-time pricing”, “intelligent service agents”, “AI-driven compliance automation”) This model works especially well for system integrators and consulting teams:\n- Align pods with industry-specific use cases like “agent-based claims processing” or “AI for smart grid operations”\n- Or build platform capabilities such as “LLMOps and Prompt Engineering” or “Vector Store \u0026amp; Retrieval Frameworks” Each pod owns a capability from architecture to deployment — including accelerators, reusable patterns, and governance The shift is from PoCs and slideware to repeatable, production-grade outcomes Tooling → From static pipelines to AI-native platforms# Replace batch processing with streaming and event-driven architectures Adopt orchestration tools that support LLM chaining, vector search, memory, and tool use Build observability in: logging, auditing, and real-time feedback for autonomous agents Make data quality and governance operational:\n- Validate inputs continuously\n- Track lineage across agent workflows\n- Enforce access, retention, and fallback policies by design In an AI-first setup, governance isn’t a gate — it’s part of how intelligent systems run safely and reliably.\nMindset → From model accuracy to system outcomes# Agentic AI isn’t just about prediction — it’s about behavior Prioritize task success, reliability, and continuous learning Learn to evaluate agents like you evaluate products: usage, satisfaction, and impact Ways of Working → Co-create with software and business# Collaborate early with software engineers (infrastructure, APIs, delivery) Involve business teams from the start — defining tasks, testing behavior, owning value Align on clear business outcomes:\n- How many decisions are being automated?\n- How much time or cost is being saved?\n- Are customer actions improving as a result? AI performance isn’t about precision — it’s about how well it supports the business in real-world workflows.\nWhat Skills Will Matter# To stay relevant, teams should start building strength in:\nData:\nReal-time pipelines Data products Embeddings and vector stores AI:\nPrompt design Agent orchestration LLM safety and evaluation Engineering:\nAPI-first architecture DevOps and CI/CD Event streaming Product:\nCapability framing Task definition Iterative feedback loops Governance:\nHuman-in-loop design Fallback logic Explainability and accountability Final Thought# Agentic AI turns data \u0026amp; AI teams into designers of intelligent behavior.\nThis shift is big — but it’s also exciting.\nIt’s no longer about optimizing pipelines or fine-tuning a model.\nIt’s about building AI that thinks, acts, and learns — and making that work in production.\nAnd the teams that embrace this now… will lead what’s next.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/posts/reclaiming-technology-leadership/","title":"Reclaiming Technology Leadership","section":"Posts","content":"\nWe’ve professionalized technology to the point where we’ve lost touch with it.\nIn many organizations, technology leadership has turned into governance, reporting, and compliance. The intent was good: control risk, manage complexity, scale globally.\nBut in doing so, many organizations created a gap between leadership and the actual technology.\nDecisions are now abstracted behind PowerPoint decks and KPIs instead of grounded in code, infrastructure, or architecture. When governance replaces guidance, you lose speed, context, and credibility. The result is a leadership layer that knows how to measure delivery but not how to drive it.\nThe cost of “governance over guidance”# Over the past decade, the balance quietly shifted.\nCIOs, CTOs, and architects became process owners instead of technology shapers. Review boards replaced design sessions. Reports replaced experimentation.\nWhat was meant to scale control ended up scaling distance.\nWhen that happens, technology stops being something you shape; it becomes something you manage.\nAnd that’s a dangerous place to be, especially now.\nThe AI shift raises the stakes# The rise of AI is not just another wave of technology. It is a structural change in how systems are built, operated, and evolve.\nIntelligent agents, adaptive architectures, and autonomous workflows are redefining what it means to design and lead technology.\nBut the impact goes much further than IT. AI is starting to reshape how entire organizations operate. Decision-making, customer interaction, and even product creation are becoming continuous, data-driven, and self-optimizing processes.\nWork is no longer defined by fixed systems and human orchestration but by dynamic, learning ecosystems that adjust in real time. The line between business and technology is dissolving.\nIn this new reality, technology leadership is not just about systems. It is about steering the behavior of intelligent, autonomous environments that shape the business itself.\nLeaders who stay distant from technology lose their ability to steer that transformation.\nWithout a real understanding of how technology works, scales, and connects across the organization, you cannot responsibly guide the adoption of AI or turn it into a sustainable advantage.\nThe gap between leadership and technology is no longer just inefficient. It is risky.\nThe fading role of the architect# No one has felt this shift more than the architect. Once the bridge between vision and engineering, many architects now find themselves reduced to administrators of complexity. Too technical for business meetings, too strategic for delivery teams.\nTheir days are filled with reviews, frameworks, and approvals, while the actual act of designing and building moves elsewhere.\nBut this is exactly the time when we need architects the most.\nAI, data, and cloud are converging into a new kind of architecture: distributed, adaptive, and continuously learning.\nWe need architects who can translate that complexity into clarity, who understand both the technical and ethical dimensions, and who can design systems that remain trustworthy even as they evolve.\nStaying intellectually close to technology# Strong leaders stay intellectually close to the technology they lead.\nThat doesn’t mean writing code every day. It means understanding why things work the way they do, and how small decisions ripple through the system.\nIt means asking questions that go one layer deeper: How does this scale? Where are the dependencies? What are the limits of what we’ve built?\nWhen leaders stay close to those questions, they build credibility and make better strategic choices.\nThe best technology organizations I know are guided by leaders who understand both the architecture and the ambition behind it.\nRebuilding a tech-first culture# Reclaiming technology leadership starts with rebuilding a culture where understanding technology is as valuable as managing it.\nThat doesn’t mean abandoning structure or accountability. It means balancing them with curiosity, experimentation, and real technical dialogue.\nGive architects space to explore, not just to approve.\nValue architectural thinking as a strategic skill, not a compliance function.\nAnd above all, reconnect leadership with the systems that now learn, reason, and act on our behalf.\nBecause in the age of AI, technology doesn’t wait for direction; it learns from it.\nAnd if leaders don’t stay close enough to guide that learning, the systems will start leading us instead.\nIt’s time to stop leading technology from a distance and start leading through it again.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/posts/the-new-role-of-the-architect-in-an-agentic-world/","title":"The New Role of the Architect in an Agentic World","section":"Posts","content":"The role of the architect is being rewritten.\nNot by new frameworks or methodologies, but by intelligent systems that can design, optimize, and learn on their own.\nAs AI agents, autonomous workflows, and generative tools become part of daily operations, architecture itself becomes dynamic.\nIt’s no longer a static blueprint. It’s a living system that continuously adapts and improves.\nFrom Control to Coordination# For years, architecture has centered on control: standards, reviews, governance.\nBut in an agentic world, control alone is not enough.\nAI systems generate code, detect anomalies, and make real-time adjustments faster than any process can document.\nThe architect’s role shifts from enforcing compliance to guiding intelligent collaboration between humans, systems, and autonomous agents.\nWe become orchestrators of interaction, not owners of process.\nAdaptive by Design# Modern architecture must be able to evolve.\nA well-designed environment responds to signals: performance, usage, or ethical risk.\nIt learns. It self-corrects.\nThis means architects no longer design systems that simply work; we design systems that grow. Adaptive ecosystems that continuously align technology with intent and outcomes.\nNew Building Blocks# Three elements define this next phase of architecture:\nAI Agents: autonomous components that analyse data, act, and improve through feedback. Policy-as-Code: governance and principles embedded directly into automation. Feedback Loops: continuous sensing and learning mechanisms that keep systems aligned with goals and values. Together, they create architectures that are aware, responsive, and self-optimising.\nThe Architect as Ecosystem Designer# The modern architect designs behaviour as much as structure.\nWe define how systems and teams interact, how decisions are made, and how accountability is shared.\nOur focus expands from technology stacks to value creation and observability, ensuring that every intelligent component contributes to business outcomes in a responsible way.\nA Redefinition of the Profession# AI will not replace architects.\nBut it will challenge us to evolve, to think less about control, and more about direction, coherence, and learning.\nThe future architect builds trust between humans and machines.\nWe design systems that think, act, and improve, responsibly and transparently.\nThe true transformation of architecture lies in its shift from structure to intelligence, evolving into a discipline that learns, adapts, and connects human and machine purpose.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/posts/ai-agents-new-consumers-producers-data/","title":"AI Agents as New Consumers and Producers of Data","section":"Posts","content":"For years, data platforms were designed around people. The main goal was to provide humans with dashboards, reports, and analytics so they could make better decisions. But this model is being reshaped. With the rise of AI agents, data platforms are entering a new era—one where the consumers of data are not only people but also autonomous systems.\nAnd here’s the important part: these agents don’t just consume. They also produce. They generate enriched datasets, annotations, and continuous insights. This dual role changes how we need to think about architecture, governance, and collaboration.\nWhy This Matters Now# Organizations have spent decades building systems to make data accessible and useful. From warehouses to lakes, from mesh to fabric, each wave aimed to improve scale, quality, and accessibility. But all of these designs assumed a human at the other end.\nAgents disrupt that assumption. They can query, reason, and act in real time. They can also create new knowledge artifacts that feed into the data platform itself. This is not a theoretical trend—already today, copilots, chatbots, and automated workflows are enriching datasets with tags, predictions, and classifications.\nIf we don’t adapt our data platforms, we risk creating environments where humans and agents operate in silos, duplicating work and reducing trust.\nOpportunities and Challenges Ahead# 1. A Two-Way Data Flow# Traditional data flows end with a human decision. In an agent-driven world, the loop closes: data goes in, actions and new data come out. For example, an AI agent monitoring energy grids might not just alert engineers about anomalies but also generate a new dataset of patterns that becomes valuable training material for future models.\n2. Lineage and Trust at Scale# When agents create data, the question of lineage becomes urgent. Which model produced this dataset? Which source data was used? Was the agent operating within its authorized scope? Without clear lineage, we risk a black box of agent-generated data, which undermines compliance and decision-making.\n3. Governance for Non-Humans# Most organizations today focus on user roles, access rights, and compliance rules for people. But agents are new actors. They need identities, access policies, and monitoring. Just as we don’t give every employee unrestricted access, we shouldn’t give agents blanket rights to read or write data. Fine-grained governance, combined with observability, will be critical.\n4. Human + Agent Collaboration# The real power lies in combining strengths. Agents can operate at scale and speed, processing volumes no human could. Humans bring context, ethical judgment, and strategic oversight. Data platforms must be designed for this hybrid model, where a compliance officer might validate a dataset enriched by an agent, or a product team might extend features based on agent-detected signals.\nWhat Data Platforms Need to Evolve# To support this shift, future platforms should:\nTreat agents as first-class citizens with identities, roles, and accountability.\nEmbed explainability so that both agent and human contributions are transparent.\nProvide shared canvases where human and agent outputs coexist, with clear versioning and traceability.\nEnable continuous governance, where policies apply equally to people and agents, across environments.\nWe can draw inspiration from service mesh and distributed architecture patterns—concepts designed to manage complexity, security, and scale in systems where many services interact. Data platforms now need their own “agent mesh,” ensuring that interactions between humans, agents, and datasets are reliable, secure, and explainable.\nA Future of Mixed Ecosystems# The enterprise of tomorrow will not be human-only or agent-only. It will be a mixed ecosystem where humans and agents collaborate side by side. Picture an operations center where human analysts and AI agents both monitor streams of data. The agents handle the noise, surfacing anomalies, while humans apply context and strategy. Both contribute datasets back to the platform, enriching it for the next cycle.\nOrganizations that adapt early will gain an edge. They will have platforms ready not just for today’s dashboards and queries, but for tomorrow’s autonomous collaboration.\nFinal Thought# Data platforms were once built for reporting. Then they were built for advanced analytics. Now they must be built for collaboration—between humans and agents alike.\nThe question is no longer whether AI agents will join our data ecosystems. They already have. The question is whether we’re ready to treat them as active participants, with the structures, governance, and trust needed to make the collaboration productive.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/posts/ai-data-factories-innovation-supply-chain/","title":"AI Factories Meet Data Factories: Building the Supply Chains of Innovation","section":"Posts","content":"Over the past few years, we’ve seen organizations experiment with the concept of an AI Factory—a structured way to industrialize the development and deployment of AI. At the same time, data leaders have embraced the idea of data products and data fabrics to make data more reusable, governed, and available at scale.\nIt’s time to bring these two together!\nFrom Projects to Production Lines# Think of how manufacturing evolved: from craft workshops to assembly lines, where processes were standardized and repeatable. We are witnessing a similar shift in data and AI. Instead of bespoke projects—each with its own tools, pipelines, and governance—organizations are moving toward industrialized AI + data factories.\nIn this model:\nData factories prepare, refine, and package high-quality data products.\nAI factories consume these products, train and deploy models, and return insights back into the business.\nTogether, they form a repeatable cycle of design → build → run → improve that can be scaled across business units.\nWhy This Matters# Today, most enterprises still lose time reinventing the wheel: rebuilding the same data pipelines, retraining similar models, solving governance issues in silos. The factory mindset replaces this with standardized components and shared services—cutting cost and time, while improving trust and compliance.\nReusability: Once a data product or model is created, it can be reused across teams and industries.\nGovernance by design: Security, privacy, and compliance are embedded, not added later.\nScalability: New use cases move from idea to production in weeks instead of months.\nWhat an AI \u0026amp; Data Supply Chain Could Look Like in 2030# By 2030, we could see organizations operating AI \u0026amp; Data Supply Chains much like today’s physical supply chains:\nRaw Material Layer: Data streaming in from IoT, transactions, documents, and external sources.\nProcessing Layer: Data factories transform raw inputs into standardized data products, with metadata describing quality, lineage, and access.\nAssembly Layer: AI factories use these data products to build models, prompts, and agentic workflows.\nDistribution Layer: Insights, predictions, and autonomous agents are deployed back into operations, products, or customer channels.\nFeedback Loop: Usage data, performance metrics, and human feedback flow back into the chain, improving both data products and AI models.\nJust as manufacturing supply chains depend on logistics, contracts, and quality control, AI \u0026amp; Data Supply Chains will depend on cloud platforms, distributed architectures, service meshes, and governance tooling.\nThe Call to Action# The shift from projects to factories is not about technology alone—it requires new operating models, new governance, and a mindset of continuous, repeatable innovation. Organizations that succeed will treat AI and data not as experiments, but as products moving along a supply chain.\nBy 2030, the companies that master this approach will be the ones creating new markets, not just keeping up with them.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/posts/stop-coding-start-coaching-declarative/","title":"Stop Coding, Start Coaching: Why It’s Time to Think Declaratively","section":"Posts","content":"We’re entering a phase where engineering is less about writing every instruction and more about teaching systems how to think. The shift is clear: from procedural to declarative. From “write every line” to “explain the outcome.” From “code it” to “coach the model.”\nThis isn’t just about GenAI. It changes how we design, build, and operate systems when AI becomes part of the team.\nCode Is No Longer the Core Output# Most engineering teams still measure productivity by the amount of code shipped. But with AI-generated code, low-code platforms, and autonomous agents, raw output is no longer the right metric.\nThe value shifts to design clarity, intent, and oversight. Models don’t need detailed instructions — they need structure, context, and outcomes they can align to.\nThink Outcome, Not Steps# Traditional development relies on procedural thinking: describe every step, control the flow, handle every exception. But AI systems work better when you describe the destination and let them find the path.\nDeclarative thinking means defining what you want — not how to get there. You already see this in tools like Terraform, Bicep, and serverless workflows. You define the desired state, and the system figures out how to get there.\nThis isn’t just more efficient — it’s more scalable in a world where logic is co-authored by machines.\nCoaching AI Is a Design Discipline# To make AI useful, you don’t code logic — you shape behavior. That means:\nFraming clear objectives and constraints Providing relevant examples and signals Reviewing outputs and edge cases Adjusting based on feedback and changing conditions You’re not programming — you’re supervising. The ability to tune, guide, and iterate becomes more valuable than the ability to write perfect functions.\nWhat This Means for Engineering Teams# If your team is still optimizing for “how fast we can code,” you’re solving the wrong problem.\nHere’s what needs to change:\nShift from function logic to system behavior Combine code review with prompt, model, and config review Train engineers to think like orchestrators, not implementers Use declarative tools where possible — especially in cloud, infra, and data workflows Define success in terms of outcomes, not just deployments The biggest challenge isn’t tooling. It’s mindset. Final Thought# Declarative thinking forces us to simplify, clarify, and trust the system to do its part. That’s how we scale in an AI-first world.\nWe don’t need more code. We need better coaching.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/posts/ai-moving-fast-leadership-faster/","title":"AI is Moving Fast. Leadership Must Move Faster","section":"Posts","content":"Artificial Intelligence isn’t slowing down. In fact, it’s speeding up — reshaping how we work, how decisions are made, and how businesses compete. But while the technology keeps evolving, leadership often struggles to keep up. And that’s where the real risk lies.\nIf you’re in a leadership role today — especially in tech, strategy, or operations — you can’t afford to treat AI as a distant future trend or a side experiment. It’s already here. The question is: are you moving fast enough to lead with it?\nThe Acceleration Problem# We’ve all seen it. Pilots turn into production in weeks instead of years. Tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and fine-tuned enterprise models are reshaping everything from coding to compliance. Meanwhile, generative AI and agentic systems are moving from prototypes to business-critical services.\nAnd yet, most leadership teams still treat AI as a tech project. That’s a mistake. The companies pulling ahead are treating it as a business model shift. They’re not waiting for a perfect roadmap. They’re learning by doing — and adjusting as they go.\nYou Don’t Need All the Answers — You Need a Point of View# The biggest blocker to progress isn’t lack of tech. It’s indecision.\nLeadership often waits for the full picture before acting. But with AI, the picture is always evolving. You need a clear stance on:\nWhere AI will impact your business most (cost, growth, productivity) What guardrails are non-negotiable (ethics, privacy, compliance) How to scale responsibly, even when things are uncertain That doesn’t mean guessing. It means building feedback loops fast. It means standing up use cases, measuring what works, and adjusting in short cycles.\nRethinking Roles and Responsibilities# AI doesn’t just change what we build. It changes how we work. Teams need new skills. Decision-making needs to shift. Governance needs to move closer to the flow of development.\nHere’s the shift I see in organizations that are getting it right:\nCTOs move from platform focus to capability acceleration CIOs own not just systems, but AI-enabled workflows CMOs tap into AI for real-time personalization COOs rethink efficiency through AI-driven automation And all of this needs board-level support — not just funding, but active involvement in AI risk, oversight, and innovation culture.\nSpeed with Guardrails# Fast doesn’t mean reckless. You need structure — especially around security, transparency, and trust. That’s where AI governance frameworks, MLOps, and data strategy come in.\nIf you don’t have:\nA responsible AI policy tied to real use cases A way to track AI model behavior post-deployment A plan for workforce re-skilling Then you’re not leading — you’re reacting.\nFinal Thought: Lead from the Front# AI is not an IT initiative. It’s a leadership agenda. And the pace won’t slow down just because we’re not ready.\nThe organizations that win won’t be the ones with the most advanced models. They’ll be the ones with leaders who move fast, act with intent, and learn in public.\nIf you’re a leader, now’s the time to move.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/posts/ai-governance-innovation-responsibility/","title":"AI Governance: Balancing Innovation and Responsibility","section":"Posts","content":"Every company wants to move fast with AI. The real challenge isn’t adoption—it’s making sure innovation is guided by responsibility and strong governance.\nThe question is not whether to adopt AI — it’s about doing it right. AI governance helps organizations find the balance between driving innovation and managing risk. It gives you the structure to build solutions that serve your business and your customers, without losing control.\nThe Innovation Challenge# Speed matters. Companies that apply AI to predictive analytics, automation, and personalization are gaining an edge — whether it’s a hospital improving diagnosis or a bank detecting fraud in real time.\nBut moving fast without the right controls can backfire. Poor governance can lead to biased models, privacy issues, or black-box systems. The impact is real — for your business and your customers.\nAI needs to be deployed in a controlled way. The goal is to keep innovation moving while staying responsible.\nBuilding the Foundation: Data and Security# Good AI starts with good data. Without it, you can’t trust the outcomes.\nThis means you need clear data governance. You must know where your data comes from, how it is processed, and who can access it. If your AI makes decisions that affect people, you must be able to explain those decisions — not just hope the model gets it right.\nSecurity is just as important. AI models often handle sensitive data. You need to secure both the data and the models to prevent misuse or attack.\nThe Human Element: Keeping People in the Loop# AI should support people, not replace them. The best AI solutions I see always include a human in the loop — especially for decisions that can impact lives.\nThis doesn’t slow innovation down. It ensures that humans and AI work together effectively. For example, an AI can flag potential risks, but the final decision can remain with a person.\nTraining is also critical. Teams must understand both what AI can do — and where it can go wrong.\n![][image2]\nPractical Steps for Implementation# Start with clear policies. Define how AI will be used, what the guardrails are, and how decisions will be monitored. Keep this practical, not theoretical.\nSet up regular audits to monitor for bias, accuracy, and compliance. AI needs ongoing review — it is not a one-time project.\nAnd bring the right people together: technical experts, business leaders, legal teams. AI governance is not an IT task — it is an organizational responsibility.\nManaging Risk Without Slowing Down# Risk management doesn’t mean saying “no” to AI. It means understanding where more controls are needed, and where a lighter touch is fine.\nA chatbot answering basic questions does not need the same level of review as an AI deciding who gets a loan. Classify your AI projects by risk, and apply governance accordingly.\nThis lets you move fast where appropriate, and stay cautious where needed.\nThe Business Case for Good Governance# Good governance builds trust — with customers, regulators, and employees. It reduces risk and improves outcomes.\nIt also makes your AI better. Clean data, clear processes, and regular monitoring all lead to better-performing AI systems.\n![][image3]\nLooking Ahead# AI will keep evolving — fast. New capabilities, new regulations, new business expectations. You need a governance approach that adapts with this change.\nThe goal is not to slow innovation. It is to make sure innovation is responsible and sustainable.\nGetting Started# Take the following steps to get started:\nBegin with your data. Build a clean, secure, well-documented data foundation. Develop practical governance policies that guide day-to-day AI decisions. Invest in training so your teams understand both AI’s power and its risks. Getting this balance right — innovation and responsibility — is what will set leading organizations apart.

A shiny object in a lab that only a few experts are allowed to touch.\nThat mindset is holding them back.\nIf you want AI to drive real impact, it needs to move out of the lab and into the engine room of your organization. That’s what the AI Factory is about. Not experiments, but execution. Not proofs of concept, but products.\nFrom Prototype to Production# We’ve all seen it before: a promising AI model built by a small data science team — but no plan to scale it, no ownership after handover, and no integration into business processes.\nThe result? Shelfware.\nThe AI Factory fixes that by treating AI like a product, not a project. It’s a structured setup where teams can build, test, deploy, and improve AI use cases at scale — reliably and securely.\nIt’s not about the tech alone. It’s about standardizing the way you work:\nShared architecture patterns Reusable components and pipelines Embedded compliance and security Clear ownership across data, IT, and business Why It Works# An AI Factory lowers the friction to deliver.\nInstead of every team reinventing the wheel, they build on a common platform. Think reusable pods for model training, deployment templates, or automated data validation tools.\nThat doesn’t just save time — it creates trust. You know what you’re building on. You know what’s allowed. You know it will run in production.\nAnd more importantly: you can measure outcomes and scale them.\nIt Changes the Culture Too# This model isn’t just for data scientists or engineers. It enables everyone across the organization to participate:\nArchitects can design with AI in mind. Developers can embed models via APIs or SDKs. Business teams can identify new use cases without waiting on central IT. When done right, the AI Factory becomes a shared capability — not a silo.\nWhat It Takes to Get There# If you’re setting this up, focus on three things:\nClear governance — who owns what, and how decisions get made. End-to-end tooling — not just model training, but data prep, versioning, monitoring, and retraining. Change leadership — because none of this works if teams still see AI as someone else’s problem. This is the hard part. But it’s also where the value is.\nFinal Thought# The AI Factory isn’t a place where things get invented. It’s where they get built — again and again, better every time.\nIf you’re serious about becoming AI-first, start treating AI like a core business capability. Not a pilot. Not a lab.\nBut the engine room powering your future.\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/posts/how-ai-and-web3-influence-each-other/","title":"How AI and Web3 Influence Each Other","section":"Posts","content":"AI and Web3 are often discussed as separate trends. But the way they’re starting to influence each other is where the real potential lies. For organizations building digital strategies, understanding how these technologies interact is becoming more important by the day.\nThis isn’t about chasing hype — it’s about practical ways these two technologies can address each other’s current limitations and open up new business models.\nWeb3 Can Help Solve AI’s Trust Problem# Trust is one of the biggest blockers for AI adoption. How can we prove that an AI model works as intended? How do we know decisions haven’t been tampered with?\nWeb3 brings a useful capability here: transparency. Blockchain provides immutable records that can be used to track how AI models are performing and how decisions are made. This isn’t theory — it’s already being explored in industries where regulatory scrutiny is high.\nExample: If an AI system is making credit decisions or processing sensitive financial data, every step of that process can be recorded on-chain. This gives auditors and regulators an independent view — without relying on any one company to “explain” what happened.\nAI Is Making Web3 Usable# Web3 platforms still have a significant usability challenge. Wallets, gas fees, transaction steps — most of this is too complex for the average user.\nAI is starting to simplify this. Natural language interfaces are reducing the learning curve. You’ll see more AI agents acting on behalf of users — handling transactions, optimizing fees, and interacting with smart contracts in the background.\nThere’s also value in applying AI to optimize the Web3 infrastructure itself. Predictive models can help manage network congestion and reduce transaction costs, making decentralized applications faster and more efficient.\nData Ownership: A Shift in the AI Model# Today’s AI models are largely trained on data controlled by a small number of cloud platforms and big tech companies. Web3 flips this — enabling models where individuals own their data and can choose how it’s used.\nThis is an important shift. Blockchain-based identity and consent mechanisms can allow people to selectively share data with AI systems — and get compensated when they do. It also gives AI systems access to more diverse, high-quality, permissioned data.\nDecentralized AI marketplaces are emerging where data contributors, model builders, and end-users can interact without intermediaries taking the largest cut.\nNew Economic Models Are Emerging# We’re also seeing early signs of new business models. AI models themselves can be tokenized — meaning developers can raise funding from a broader community, and token holders can share in future revenue.\nThis approach could open up AI innovation to smaller teams that can’t easily access traditional venture capital. It also better aligns incentives between those building AI systems and those using them.\nThere Are Still Big Technical Challenges# Of course, there are limits.\nBlockchains aren’t optimized for high-speed AI inference — processing AI workloads fully on-chain is still impractical for most use cases. Privacy is a challenge. Blockchain’s transparency and AI’s need for confidential data don’t always align. Technologies like zero-knowledge proofs show promise, but they aren’t mature enough yet for broad deployment. The skills gap is very real. It’s hard enough to find AI talent or blockchain talent — finding expertise that bridges both is even harder. What Should Organizations Do?# You don’t need to wait for all of this to mature before starting.\nThere are practical steps you can take now:\nUse blockchain to record and verify AI model outputs in regulated processes. Experiment with token-based incentives for data sharing — especially in environments where user trust is critical. Focus first on solving real business problems, not on implementing technology for its own sake. Partnerships will be key. Building everything in-house isn’t realistic for most organizations. Collaborating with players who have complementary strengths will accelerate your ability to explore these opportunities.\nThe Road Ahead# As both AI and Web3 mature, their influence on each other will grow. We’ll move toward systems where AI agents can transact and negotiate autonomously via smart contracts. This will reshape ideas around digital ownership, IP rights, and compensation models for data and AI contributions.\nThe organizations that take the time to understand this shift — and experiment with it now — will be better positioned as these capabilities go mainstream.\nThis isn’t just about adding new features. It’s about building digital systems that are more transparent, user-friendly, and fair — and that can unlock new sources of value.\n"}]
