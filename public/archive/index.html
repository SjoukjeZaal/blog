    <p>Digital organisations work in new ways that require us all to adapt and develop new skills and framing and making sense of the world. How to tackle this is one of the more difficult challenges requiring addressing in a digital transformation.
Dave, Sjoukje &amp; Rob talk with Micheal Hamman, Teacher and Coach, about different styles of organisation and about how our beliefs can impact how we act. He also talks about the over emphasis on the engineering mindset, how we need to consider the human technologies and how all of our &#34;human operating systems&#34; may require some new apps.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Conversations around the short and long term risks and potentially significant unintended consequences of AI are increasing in volume. This has culminated recently in a controversial open letter, coordinated by Future of Life institute, from hundreds of leading figures in this space, including Elon Musk, asking for development and AI learning to be paused, until it is better understood. “Advanced AI could represent a profound change in the history of life on Earth, and should be planned for and managed with commensurate care and resources,”the letter says.“Unfortunately, this level of planning and management is not happening, even though recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.”

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Digitalisation in an inherently complex activity, with unknowns being very high and experimentation required on an ongoing basis - there is no ‘once and done’. The changes in leadership framing, decision making and ways of working required are hugely under estimated in discussions and planning of ’transformation’ and failure to engage with that could risk your success.
Dave, Sjoukje &amp; Rob talk with Dave Snowden, Director and Founder of the Cynefin Centre about his work on making sense of complexity, they discuss Dave’s seminal work, the Cynefin Framework, how he has subsequently built on that thinking and how you apply that it in the digitalisation process of your organisation. His insights are not to be missed.

    <p>Platform engineering is a core part of modern digital operating models. The discipline has been developing over the last 10 years and provides underlying safe, secure and optimised platforms, essential for creative and customer centric innovation.
Dave, Sjoukje &amp; Rob talk with Jennifer Riggins, Tech Culture Author about what good platform engineering looks like, why conditions today could lead to good platform engineering practices, how platforms help organisations innovate and deal with technical complexity, how it leads to strong DevOps implementation and how it helps deal with a major issue in tech today, developer cognitive overload.

    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Legacy modernisation is one of the most difficult, and often misunderstood, elements of digital transformation. It can be expensive and very disruptive. It has more in common with business transformation than cloud migration and can lend itself to risky large scale implementations.
Dave, Sjoukje &amp; Rob are joined by John Kodumal, CTO and Co-Founder of LaunchDarkly, they talk about how greenfield development is increasingly rare, evolving a running system is much more common. New method and tools are now available to move this past a static or quarterly update, risk heavy process, such as feature management which allows legacy to be modernised with zero outage and switch over risk.

    <p>&#34;Digital transformation&#34; a phrase that has been used for years, often thought to be overused and perhaps hollow, maybe coming of age. This week we look into this phrase and what its meant over the years, but also try to understand what’s changed to make it more material.
Dave, Sjoukje &amp; Rob talk with Jeff DeVerter, Tech Evangelist from Rackspace about what has made this real in 2023 and what is different organisationally, culturally and technically in a &#34;digitally transformed&#34; organisation. Also, they try to understand the difference between digitisation and digitalisation, how this may change professions and how this type of transformation can help us become more customer relevant.

    <p>TelCo is a Sector where Cloud based software defined networks are driving customer expectations combined with potentially providing huge operational efficiencies. Telcos are increasingly moving their networks to the cloud, recognizing the significant advantages this can provide – 31% of global network capacity is being serviced by cloud today, and this is expected to increase to 46% in the next 3 to 5 years.
Dave, Sjoukje &amp; Rob talk with Geoff Hollingworth, CMO of Rakuten Symphony about their experience as a Cloud Native Telco, and what we can learn by looking at what is possible on the other side of cloud transformation. The team explore what a telco cloud transformation is (is it different from cloud transformation in other sectors?), the operational differences between a Cloud Native and traditional Telco and cloud transformation progress and nuances in the sector
