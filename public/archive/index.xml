      <title>Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty - maintain control over strategic digital assets</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Governments and organizations are focusing on digital transformation to fundamentally transform the way they operate and deliver services to their customers. Cloud adoption has increased tremendously in the last couple of years, also due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But as they move to the cloud, organizations want to maintain the same level of control over their IT resources as they have in their datacenters. Concerns about cloud sovereignty, which includes data, operational, and technical issues, are not new and have been increasing because of rising geopolitical tensions; changing data and privacy laws in different countries; the dominant role of cloud players concentrated in a few regions; and the lessons learned through the pandemic. As a result, governments and organizations are re-evaluating their external exposure and looking for ways to maintain physical and digital control over strategic assets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sustainability and humanity&amp;rsquo;s response to climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our lifetime. And luckily, this is becoming more important for most companies, across all different industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Capgemini we set a bold &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.capgemini.com/our-company/our-corporate-social-responsibility-program/environmental-sustainability/&#34;&gt;ambition&lt;/a&gt;: We will achieve carbon neutrality no later than 2025 and become a net zero business by 2030. This means accelerating our approach to carbon reduction across our key impact areas. And together with reducing our own environmental impacts for a net zero future, we also want to help our clients to transform to a low carbon future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/archive/microsoft-azure-well-architected-framework-five-pillars-of-architecture-excellence-copy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft recently introduced the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/&#34;&gt;Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework&lt;/a&gt; which provides customers with a set of Azure best-practices to help them build and deliver well-architected solutions on top of the Azure platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framework consists of five pillars of architecture excellence, that can be used as guiding to improve the quality of the workloads that run on Azure. These five pillars are: Cost Optimization, Operational Excellence, Performance Efficiency, Reliability, and Security. They will be explained in more detail in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most companies typically go through a set of phases the in their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.capgemini.com/in-en/partner/microsoft/#applications-and-infrastructure&#34;&gt;Microsoft cloud journey&lt;/a&gt;. They start with experimenting with the cloud for rapid application development. A single subscription is manually created in the Azure portal, and a set of services is quickly deployed from the portal to serve business and the developer&amp;rsquo;s needs. It is even not uncommon in this phase, for the business or for developers to use their own credit card for creating this single subscription. The main goal in this phase is mostly serving business needs quickly, creating small proof of concepts, or avoiding the lengthy and time-consuming deployment strategies of bigger organizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2 Different Ways of Using Azure Key Vault in Your Logic Apps</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/archive/2-ways-azure-key-vault-logic-apps/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;2-different-ways-of-using-azure-key-vault-in-your-logic-apps&#34;&gt;2 different ways of using Azure Key Vault in your Logic Apps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security is key nowadays and this means that you should secure your applications to the max. Azure Key Vault offers you a way to safely store your credentials, certificates and hardware security modules in Azure. These values can also be used inside your custom applications, like in web applications, Azure Functions, and Azure Logic Apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azure Logic Apps offers an out-of-the-box connector that you can use to retrieve values easily and use them in your Logic App. However, there is a caveat here. You cannot use Managed Identities to access the Key Vault using the connector. Managed Identities are service principals in Azure Active Directory that are used to connect different services. You can use the identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, including Key Vault, without any credentials in your code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Azure Active Directory Flavors</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/archive/azure-active-directory-flavors/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Azure Active Directory is the heart of everything inside of Microsoft Azure. All Azure services are depending on it and using it for Identity Management in the Microsoft Cloud. Office 365, Intune, Exchange Online, Enterprise Mobility Suite, are all examples of Azure Services depending on Azure Active directory for both security and identity management. And when implemented right, all your custom applications, which are hosted in Azure or somehow are integrating with Azure services are using Azure Active Directory as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first part in a series on how to use SSL Certificates in your BizTalk Application to secure your data transfer when connecting to third party (web) services. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain how to install the certificates in the BizTalk servers certificate store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ssl-certificates&#34;&gt;SSL Certificates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSL certificates contain a private (.pfx) and a public key (.cer) which will need to be installed in the appropriate certification stores. (For more information on SSL Certificates you can read the following article: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SSL-Certificates-HOWTO/x64.html&#34;&gt;http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SSL-Certificates-HOWTO/x64.html.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Afgelopen maart heeft Microsoft Azure App Services gelanceerd. App Services is een samenvoeging van verschillende services n.l., Web Apps (wat voorheen Azure Websites was), Mobile Apps (wat gebaseerd is op Azure Mobile Services) en 2 nieuwe services, Logic Apps en API Apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Met deze nieuwe services biedt Microsoft een breed scala aan mogelijkheden. Met Web Apps en Mobile Apps kunnen ontwikkelaars web applicaties en mobiele applicaties bouwen. Met Logic Apps is het mogelijk om integratieoplossingen te ontwikkelen en deze onderdelen kunnen onderling met elkaar communiceren d.m.v. API Apps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/archive/connecting-oracle-database-ssis-2008/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I had to connect to an Oracle Database using SSIS 2008. I had a couple of issues installing the Oracle Client tools, the Microsoft Connector for Oracle Provided by Attunity and the configuration on the client side (my SSIS server) and the server side (the Oracle Database server).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides that, it took me an awful lot of time reading the amount of information written on this subject before actually finding the right solution for making the connection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I will guide you through installing and configuring the Workflow Manager for SharePoint 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting the installation of the Workflow Manager, make sure that at least the &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;2767999&#34;&gt;SharePoint 2013 March Public Update (KB 2767999)&lt;/a&gt; is installed on toy SharePoint Server. This update has some bug fixes and added extra support for the Workflow Manager and workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-the-workflow-manager&#34;&gt;Installing the Workflow Manager&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is best to install the Workflow Manager using the Web Platform Installer tool. This will automatically install all the prerequisites like Service Bus 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first part in a series of posts about SharePoint 2013 Workflows. In this post we will discuss the architecture and improvements of the new Workflow Model in SharePoint 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;workflow-architecture&#34;&gt;Workflow Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the SharePoint 2010 workflow model, which is still part of the SharePoint 2013 installation, Microsoft introduced a new Workflow architecture in SharePoint 2013 (and Office 365).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SharePoint 2013 is now using Workflow Manager 1.0 which acts as the host for the workflow runtime, is hosting the latest version of Windows Workflow Foundation (WF 4.5) and unlike the 2010 Workflow model, is totally decoupled from SharePoint using OAuth secured WCF Services. SharePoint 2013 is configured to send all related tasks to the workflow manager to execute workflows using these services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leveraging Azure Marketplace Data in SharePoint Part 1: Consuming Azure Marketplace Data in BCS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Azure Marketplace data is a service by Microsoft that hosts WCF services in Windows Azure. Organizations and individuals can consume that data via a subscription model. These services expose data using REST services which can be leveraged in SharePoint using BCS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this example we are going to use US Crime data statistics Service (DATA.gov). By using BCS we can consume the Azure WCF Service and display this data in SharePoint via an External List.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
