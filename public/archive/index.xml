      <description>&lt;p&gt;Digital organisations work in new ways that require us all to adapt and develop new skills and framing and making sense of the world.  How to tackle this is one of the more difficult challenges requiring addressing in a digital transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave, Sjoukje &amp;amp; Rob talk with Micheal Hamman, Teacher and Coach, about different styles of organisation and about how our beliefs can impact how we act.  He also talks about the over emphasis on the engineering mindset, how we need to consider the human technologies and how all of our &amp;quot;human operating systems&amp;quot; may require some new apps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conversations around the short and long term risks and potentially significant unintended consequences of AI are increasing in volume.  This has culminated recently in a controversial open letter, coordinated by Future of Life institute, from hundreds of leading figures in this space, including Elon Musk, asking for development and AI learning to be paused, until it is better understood.  &lt;em&gt;“Advanced AI could represent a profound change in the history of life on Earth, and should be planned for and managed with commensurate care and resources,”&lt;em&gt;the letter says.&lt;/em&gt;“Unfortunately, this level of planning and management is not happening, even though recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Digitalisation in an inherently complex activity, with unknowns being very high and experimentation required on an ongoing basis - there is no &amp;lsquo;once and done&amp;rsquo;.  The changes in leadership framing, decision making and ways of working required are hugely under estimated in discussions and planning of &amp;rsquo;transformation&amp;rsquo; and failure to engage with that could risk your success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave, Sjoukje &amp;amp; Rob talk with Dave Snowden, Director and Founder of the Cynefin Centre about his work on making sense of complexity, they discuss Dave&amp;rsquo;s seminal work, the Cynefin Framework, how he has subsequently built on that thinking and how you apply that it in the digitalisation process of your organisation.  His insights are not to be missed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI usability and adoption continues to rapidly accelerate in 2023, but it is important to understand the risks to your business from mis-using AI and best practices for evaluating the right AI tools for the right jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave, Sjoukje &amp;amp; Rob talk with Michelle Zhou, Founder and CEO of Juji, about her history and take on the progression of AI over the last 20 years, why democratisation of AI is both increases the safety and precision of AI, as well as likely driving the right and best human experiences.  Also, how do you nurture your AI?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The state of platform engineering with Jennifer Riggins, Tech Culture Journalist</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/archive/2023-03-30-the-state-of-platform-engineering-with-jennifer-ri/</link>

      <title>Modernising software systems with John Kodumal, LaunchDarkly</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/archive/2023-03-23-modernising-software-systems-with-john-kodumal-lau/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Legacy modernisation is one of the most difficult, and often misunderstood, elements of digital transformation.  It can be expensive and very disruptive.  It has more in common with business transformation than cloud migration and can lend itself to risky large scale implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave, Sjoukje &amp;amp; Rob are joined by John Kodumal, CTO and Co-Founder of LaunchDarkly, they talk about how greenfield development is increasingly rare, evolving a running system is much more common.  New method and tools are now available to move this past a static or quarterly update, risk heavy process, such as feature management which allows legacy to be modernised with zero outage and switch over risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Digital transformation&amp;quot; a phrase that has been used for years, often thought to be overused and perhaps hollow, maybe coming of age.  This week we look into this phrase and what its meant over the years, but also try to understand what&amp;rsquo;s changed to make it more material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave, Sjoukje &amp;amp; Rob talk with Jeff DeVerter, Tech Evangelist from Rackspace about what has made this real in 2023 and what is different organisationally, culturally and technically in a &amp;quot;digitally transformed&amp;quot; organisation.  Also, they try to understand the difference between digitisation and digitalisation, how this may change professions and how this type of transformation can help us become more customer relevant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TelCo is a Sector where Cloud based software defined networks are driving customer expectations combined with potentially providing huge operational efficiencies.  Telcos are increasingly moving their networks to the cloud, recognizing the significant advantages this can provide – 31% of global network capacity is being serviced by cloud today, and this is expected to increase to 46% in the next 3 to 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave, Sjoukje &amp;amp; Rob talk with Geoff Hollingworth, CMO of Rakuten Symphony about their experience as a Cloud Native Telco, and what we can learn by looking at what is possible on the other side of cloud transformation.  The team explore what a telco cloud transformation is (is it different from cloud transformation in other sectors?), the operational differences between a Cloud Native and traditional Telco and cloud transformation progress and nuances in the sector&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For some special Christmas food for thought, we focus on the far reaches of our “Realities”.  Here on the show we believe that interventional, courageous leadership combined with cloud can change the future reality of a business or human.  But, what is real? What is not? And does it matter?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look at the thinking currently happening in the space of the Simulation Hypothesis, which suggests that we likely live in a computer simulation, and ask how it can be applied to solve “better problems” and improve our innovation ambition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our three launch episodes, Dave and Sjoukje look at the cloud market from three different angles: the market itself, how CxO’s are viewing that market and from a personal leadership experience perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our final launch episode, they talk to Systemic Leadership Sherpa, Alastair Kidd about how embarking on a cloud transformation journey could also be a personal development journey!  How that could help reframe your leadership action to more effectively drive business value out of the cloud and why you need to be aware of the Complexity Paradox!  Finally, they talk about Googles recent announcement about opening new regions in Europe and speculate on why.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On September 13, we hosted our first XPLR.Lowlands meetup. This was a full virtual event, streamed from our community studio. We hosted the following sessions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sessions&#34;&gt;Sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;%22https://lowlands.events/xplr-lowlands-september/navigating-the-world-of-ai-infrastructure-as-a-data-scientist/%22&#34;&gt;Navigating the world of AI infrastructure as a data scientist&lt;/a&gt;: Gabrielle Davelaar &amp;amp; Ekaterina Sirazitdinova&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally hardware has always been a job for a High Performance Specialist. With the arrival of State-of-the-Art models such as GPT-3, Turing and Megatron-Turing more compute has been proven to be necessary. This talk is about how to navigate through the world of GPU’s, bandwidth, parallelization from a data science perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty - maintain control over strategic digital assets</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Governments and organizations are focusing on digital transformation to fundamentally transform the way they operate and deliver services to their customers. Cloud adoption has increased tremendously in the last couple of years, also due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But as they move to the cloud, organizations want to maintain the same level of control over their IT resources as they have in their datacenters. Concerns about cloud sovereignty, which includes data, operational, and technical issues, are not new and have been increasing because of rising geopolitical tensions; changing data and privacy laws in different countries; the dominant role of cloud players concentrated in a few regions; and the lessons learned through the pandemic. As a result, governments and organizations are re-evaluating their external exposure and looking for ways to maintain physical and digital control over strategic assets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/archive/2022-04-22-global-xr-talks-april-2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This Global XR Talks, Alexander Meijers presented the following session:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-microsoft-remote-assist-and-guides&#34;&gt;Introduction to Microsoft Remote Assist and Guides&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft offers a broad range of solutions modernizing field services with Mixed Reality for technicians. It empowers them by offering modern tools like Mixed Reality devices, Video calls, Annotations and File Sharing capabilities. These tools allow field service workers to solve complex problems even faster, collaborate together with experts and gives them easy access to work orders. Another one of them is creating customized training modules for new workers on the factory floor. Using Dynamics 365 and Microsoft HoloLens 2 we are able to create augmented training which allows new workers to be more quickly in learning their daily job, support workers in complex tasks and even guide audits. This session will give you an introduction to both first-party apps of Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Having come across of many examples, especially within the financial sector (Banks, Insurance, Pensions), where data, modelling and IT activities take place in different teams across departments, we know about some of the pains of our customers. So how can technology, and in particular Azure technology, help here? During this Azure Thursday event we will discuss and experience how Azure Synapse Analytics together with Azure Machine Learning can help relieve some of these pains. We will show you how a model can be deployed as a stand-alone API, and how easy it is to use the same model to score records in a traditional data warehouse. In this way, we hope to give a flavor of how state-of-the art techniques can go hand-in-hand with more traditional ways of processing and storing data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Most companies use Microsoft Azure as their cloud. With the use of Azure, companies are bringing sensitive data to Azure. Just as on-premises you want to make sure that your data is well protected and is compliant with the law and regulations of your company’s industry. Azure has all components available to create a next-gen SOC. In this session,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sustainability and humanity&amp;rsquo;s response to climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our lifetime. And luckily, this is becoming more important for most companies, across all different industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Capgemini we set a bold &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.capgemini.com/our-company/our-corporate-social-responsibility-program/environmental-sustainability/&#34;&gt;ambition&lt;/a&gt;: We will achieve carbon neutrality no later than 2025 and become a net zero business by 2030. This means accelerating our approach to carbon reduction across our key impact areas. And together with reducing our own environmental impacts for a net zero future, we also want to help our clients to transform to a low carbon future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;arjan-nieuwenhuis-keeping-track-on-all-your-apps&#34;&gt;Arjan Nieuwenhuis: Keeping track on all your apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing your apps during the whole software development lifecycle and beyond is hard as apps come in all shapes and sizes and can target multiple platforms. Keeping track on your apps from early stage development to production can be a handful, especially as target platforms are whole ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The September event was the first event after summer break and our first in-person event since March 2020! Of course, we streamed the event to our YouTube channel as well. This time we have two amazing speaker again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stacey-cashmore-building-your-personal-online-brand-using-static-blazor-apps-one-step-at-a-time&#34;&gt;Stacey Cashmore: Building your personal online brand using Static Blazor Apps, one step at a time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re told that by using services such as Medium, dev.to etc that we are diluting our personal brand. That we should be posting to our own site and building ourselves up. But making that move can seem huge! Rather than eating the elephant - which can seem impossible - how about slowly moving to your own space? Build your brand whilst still using those great features that attracted you to your chosen platform in the first place. With the joint power of client-side Blazor and static web apps in Azure you no longer need to run web servers or App Services in order to host your site online. You can get set up in minutes! In this session we&amp;rsquo;ll set up a new Blazor Wasm Application and Azure Function, deploy to Azure and then fetch blog posts from dev.to to link to them in our page. We&amp;rsquo;ll also talk about next steps - and how to eat the elephant one bite at a time - to create your personal brand!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;DevOps, Scrum, infrastructure-as-code, AVD, and cloud: what do they mean to the sysadmin? Many organizations are on the eve of, or already busy with, the migration from a traditional management or project organization to an agile approach, but what does such a transition entail?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;yusuf-yusuf--monitoring--debugging-distributed-systems-in-azure&#34;&gt;Yusuf Yusuf | Monitoring &amp;amp; Debugging Distributed Systems in Azure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of containers and container orchestrator has made it easier for people to develop distributed systems. Distributed systems have the benefit of making an application more scalable and reliable. But when something goes wrong within that system, it becomes more difficult to pinpoint and fix the issue compared to a standard single system. In this session I will demonstrate how with the help of Azure Monitor, you can not only detect and diagnose issues, but also visualize performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft recently released the Chromium version of Microsoft Edge for HoloLens. This means that a lot of Web APIs that weren&amp;rsquo;t previously available now can be used, like the WebXR Device API for example. By building a simple game, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how you can use WebXR and other APIs on the HoloLens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/archive/microsoft-azure-well-architected-framework-five-pillars-of-architecture-excellence-copy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft recently introduced the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/&#34;&gt;Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework&lt;/a&gt; which provides customers with a set of Azure best-practices to help them build and deliver well-architected solutions on top of the Azure platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framework consists of five pillars of architecture excellence, that can be used as guiding to improve the quality of the workloads that run on Azure. These five pillars are: Cost Optimization, Operational Excellence, Performance Efficiency, Reliability, and Security. They will be explained in more detail in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/archive/what-a-cloud-center-of-excellence-can-do-for-your-organization/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most companies typically go through a set of phases the in their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.capgemini.com/in-en/partner/microsoft/#applications-and-infrastructure&#34;&gt;Microsoft cloud journey&lt;/a&gt;. They start with experimenting with the cloud for rapid application development. A single subscription is manually created in the Azure portal, and a set of services is quickly deployed from the portal to serve business and the developer&amp;rsquo;s needs. It is even not uncommon in this phase, for the business or for developers to use their own credit card for creating this single subscription. The main goal in this phase is mostly serving business needs quickly, creating small proof of concepts, or avoiding the lengthy and time-consuming deployment strategies of bigger organizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Azure Arc for Servers: Getting started</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/archive/2019-12-29-azure-arc-for-servers-getting-started/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most organizations embrace a hybrid and multi cloud approach for their businesses. This will give them the full benefits of their on-premises investments, the ability to innovate using cloud technologies, and the ability to avoid vendor lock-in.
For the last two years, Microsoft is investing enormously in enabling seamless hybrid capabilities. They released Azure Stack, which enables a consistent cloud model, but is deployed on-premises. They enabled security threat protection for any infrastructure, which is fully powered from the cloud, and they enabled the ability to run Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services AI models anywhere. Microsoft recently released Azure Arc, which unlocks new hybrid scenarios for organizations by bringing new Azure services and management features to any infrastructure.
Azure Arc extends the Azure Resource Manager capabilities to Linux and Windows servers, and Kubernetes clusters on any infrastructure across on-premises, multi-cloud, and the edge. You can use Azure Arc to run Azure data services anywhere, which includes always up-to-date data capabilities, deployment in seconds, and dynamic scalability on any infrastructure. Azure Arc for Servers is currently in preview, and that is what we are going to cover in this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many companies fail to understand and implement Azure governance. This can result in many unwanted results, like accidentally deleting resources in your Azure environment, non-compliance with external regulations, deploying costly resources, or deploying resources in the wrong Azure regions. The solution to this is Azure governance, the ongoing process of managing, monitoring, and auditing the use of Azure resources to meet the goals and requirements of your organization.
In this session we are going to look at Azure Blueprints, Azure Policy, Management Groups and the Resource Graph to effectively manage your Azure environment.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another Azure Content Spotlight! These articles are used to highlight items in Azure that could be more visible to the Azure community.
This weeks content spotlight is about Cognitive Service Containers, which is released in preview last week. There was a high demand for the flexibility to deploy AI applications in a variety of environments. By deploying Cognitive Services in containers, data can be analyzed close to where the actual data resides. And these containers can be deployed on on-premises environments as well, so customer data (e.g., the image or text that is being analyzed) is not sent to Microsoft.
For information and how to get started with Cognitive Service Containers, you can refer to the below links:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another Azure Content Spotlight! These articles are used to highlight items in Azure that could be more visible to the Azure community.
This weeks content spotlight is about App migration to Azure. The Cloud is changing the way applications are architected. Instead of monoliths, applications are decomposed into smaller services. These services communicate with each other through APIs or using asynchronous messaging. They can scale horizontally, so new instances can be added and removed easily. Deployments must be automated and monitoring is critical for gaining insights into the applications. And this all can be realized without the need to bother about the underlying infrastructure.
This changing way of designing and architecting applications, introduces new architectural patterns and best practices for building apps on the Azure cloud platform. Below is a set of resources which can help software architects and developers gaining insights about the different services and resources Azure has to offer to compose your applications. It also provides different patterns and best practices on how to design your applications.

Microsoft has made a huge step in their drive to eliminate passwords for good!
In the next Windows updates, they&amp;rsquo;re adding a limited preview of FIDO2 security key support. This will improve security significantly and cut the risk of phishing attacks.This new capability will give employees the ability to sign in to an Azure Active Directory-joined Windows 10 PC without a username or password. All that is needed is to insert a &lt;a href=&#34;%22https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/%22&#34;&gt;FIDO2&lt;/a&gt;compliant security key into their USB port and they will automatically be signed in to the device and get Single-sign on access to all Azure AD protected cloud resources.
Check out the following video to see how this works:

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, you need to download and install the Office 365 Developer Tools:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/office-tools-vs.aspx&#34;&gt;https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/office-tools-vs.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first part in the series on developing an Office 365 app. In
this article I will explain how you can associate your Office 365
account with Azure AD, which is the first step in Developing Office 365
Apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case I&amp;rsquo;ve created an Office 365 Developer account using my MSDN

      <title>2 Different Ways of Using Azure Key Vault in Your Logic Apps</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;2-different-ways-of-using-azure-key-vault-in-your-logic-apps&#34;&gt;2 different ways of using Azure Key Vault in your Logic Apps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security is key nowadays and this means that you should secure your applications to the max. Azure Key Vault offers you a way to safely store your credentials, certificates and hardware security modules in Azure. These values can also be used inside your custom applications, like in web applications, Azure Functions, and Azure Logic Apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azure Logic Apps offers an out-of-the-box connector that you can use to retrieve values easily and use them in your Logic App. However, there is a caveat here. You cannot use Managed Identities to access the Key Vault using the connector. Managed Identities are service principals in Azure Active Directory that are used to connect different services. You can use the identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, including Key Vault, without any credentials in your code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Azure Active Directory is the heart of everything inside of Microsoft Azure. All Azure services are depending on it and using it for Identity Management in the Microsoft Cloud. Office 365, Intune, Exchange Online, Enterprise Mobility Suite, are all examples of Azure Services depending on Azure Active directory for both security and identity management. And when implemented right, all your custom applications, which are hosted in Azure or somehow are integrating with Azure services are using Azure Active Directory as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/archive/digitale-transformatie-microsoft-azure-als-verbindende-factor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Veel bedrijven maken tegenwoordig een digitale transformatie door. Dit
modewoord duikt overal op. Als ik zoek naar een aantal definities van
wat digitale transformatie nu eigenlijk inhoudt, dan komt het volgende
o.a. naar voren:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digitale transformatie betreft de impact van (digitale) technologieën
en de toenemende digitalisering van bedrijfsprocessen op mens, bedrijf
en zelfs maatschappij.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organisaties die zich richten op de verdigitalisering van het
landschap door in te spelen op de (veranderende) wensen en behoeften
van klant, werknemers en maatschappij.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first part in a series on how to use SSL Certificates in your BizTalk Application to secure your data transfer when connecting to third party (web) services. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain how to install the certificates in the BizTalk servers certificate store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ssl-certificates&#34;&gt;SSL Certificates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSL certificates contain a private (.pfx) and a public key (.cer) which will need to be installed in the appropriate certification stores. (For more information on SSL Certificates you can read the following article: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SSL-Certificates-HOWTO/x64.html&#34;&gt;http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SSL-Certificates-HOWTO/x64.html.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Afgelopen maart heeft Microsoft Azure App Services gelanceerd. App Services is een samenvoeging van verschillende services n.l., Web Apps (wat voorheen Azure Websites was), Mobile Apps (wat gebaseerd is op Azure Mobile Services) en 2 nieuwe services, Logic Apps en API Apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Met deze nieuwe services biedt Microsoft een breed scala aan mogelijkheden. Met Web Apps en Mobile Apps kunnen ontwikkelaars web applicaties en mobiele applicaties bouwen. Met Logic Apps is het mogelijk om integratieoplossingen te ontwikkelen en deze onderdelen kunnen onderling met elkaar communiceren d.m.v. API Apps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I had to connect to an Oracle Database using SSIS 2008. I had a couple of issues installing the Oracle Client tools, the Microsoft Connector for Oracle Provided by Attunity and the configuration on the client side (my SSIS server) and the server side (the Oracle Database server).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides that, it took me an awful lot of time reading the amount of information written on this subject before actually finding the right solution for making the connection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I will guide you through installing and configuring the Workflow Manager for SharePoint 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting the installation of the Workflow Manager, make sure that at least the &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;2767999&#34;&gt;SharePoint 2013 March Public Update (KB 2767999)&lt;/a&gt; is installed on toy SharePoint Server. This update has some bug fixes and added extra support for the Workflow Manager and workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-the-workflow-manager&#34;&gt;Installing the Workflow Manager&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is best to install the Workflow Manager using the Web Platform Installer tool. This will automatically install all the prerequisites like Service Bus 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first part in a series of posts about SharePoint 2013 Workflows. In this post we will discuss the architecture and improvements of the new Workflow Model in SharePoint 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;workflow-architecture&#34;&gt;Workflow Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the SharePoint 2010 workflow model, which is still part of the SharePoint 2013 installation, Microsoft introduced a new Workflow architecture in SharePoint 2013 (and Office 365).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SharePoint 2013 is now using Workflow Manager 1.0 which acts as the host for the workflow runtime, is hosting the latest version of Windows Workflow Foundation (WF 4.5) and unlike the 2010 Workflow model, is totally decoupled from SharePoint using OAuth secured WCF Services. SharePoint 2013 is configured to send all related tasks to the workflow manager to execute workflows using these services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I found a very handy tool to check your computer or server security settings: The Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer. This tool determines if Windows administrative vulnerabilities are present, If weak passwords are being used and it checks if there are any vulnerabilities in IIS and SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing the tool you can scan your server or computer. After completion it provides you with a detailed report and instructions on how to make your environment more secure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to debug your SharePoint 2013 on-premise workflows you need to allow the workflow manager to access your system through the firewall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the following steps to allow the workflow manager to access your system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Control Panel, choose System and Security and then Windows Firewall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Control Panel Home list, choose the Advanced Settings link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the left pane of Windows Firewall, choose Inbound Rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Inbound Rules list, choose Workflow Manager Tools 1.0 for Visual Studio 2012 – Test Service Host.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Actions list, choose Enable Rule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the properties page of your SharePoint project, choose the SharePoint tab, and then select the Enable Workflow debugging check box.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leveraging Azure Marketplace Data in SharePoint Part 1: Consuming Azure Marketplace Data in BCS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Azure Marketplace data is a service by Microsoft that hosts WCF services in Windows Azure. Organizations and individuals can consume that data via a subscription model. These services expose data using REST services which can be leveraged in SharePoint using BCS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this example we are going to use US Crime data statistics Service (DATA.gov). By using BCS we can consume the Azure WCF Service and display this data in SharePoint via an External List.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
